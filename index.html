    <h1 class="inlined">Hi, I'm RÃ©mi</h1>
  </div>

  <p>I'm a Ruby on Rails developer, a writer, and a former stained-glass master (yup).</p>

  <p>I've built this corner of the web <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">to share what I learn while building software</a>, to jot down <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/fragments">unedited notes</a>, to scribble <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/scribbles">random thoughts</a>, and to share bits about <a href="{{ '/about' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">myself</a>.

  <p>I help companies build their product and make a dent in the universe. I'm currently funemployed and busy restoring a 18th-century house. When I <em>do</em> code, my toolbox includes beautiful Ruby, magical Rails, and plenty of other nerdy things. You can also check <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/now">what I'm doing right now</a>.</p>

  <p>There is no tracking on this website. So, enjoy this moment of privacy!</p>
