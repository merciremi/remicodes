Acquiring languages != learning languages

This video describes my own path with getting intimate with the English language these past years:
- no grammar, no corrections
- listen to people describing simple things for you
- talk as much as you can, to whoever you can
- read stories you already know in your target language
- do not focus on "learning", accept that you'll suck at it for some time

I'm currently acquiring German that way. Ich kanne noch nicht Deutsch sprechen aber verstuche ich ☺️.
