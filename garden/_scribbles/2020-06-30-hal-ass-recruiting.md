I've been receiving an increasing number of work opportunities over the past six months. I always try to reply, even if I know a message was sent through a script scraping Github or Linkedin for developers' profile. But let's face it, whether people reaching out are from HR or members of tech teams, it always feels _odd_. I've compiled a list of things, ranging from akward to rude that I've experienced lately.

I know recruiting developers is tough (for now) so, I'll try to be as factual as possible. And of course, I'll keep updating the list as examples come in.

Received numerous emails telling me about of __young__ teams are:

> The average age is 27. So we're a vibrant, young and playful team.

I'm 36. And I have a second full time job that awaits me in the evening (kids). So, how am I gonna fit in a team that hasn't experienced being responsible for other human beings? How this is going to play when I'll leave at 5pm to go and take care of the young ones?

Replied to a HR person that had reached out. I explained that I dig back-end more than front-end, and that I'm more into Vanilla Javascript than JS frameworks.

After she wrote back "Sure, no probs, we'll help you level up", I hopped on a call. Once on the phone, she asked about my expertise with JS frameworks. When I replied "As I stated before, close to none", she said:

> "Well, may be you could practise a bit for a few months and get back to us. You're on our radar."

Well, since you wasted an hour of my time, you're not.

Got an email that looks like a canned email from a CTO. Replied that I'm not available at the moment. He replied back to thank me. Done.

Then, a week later, I got the same canned email from the same CTO, giving me the same speech.

> Our app is build with React for the front-end.

Like 90% of apps built by startups these last two years by the number of mentions I've got so far. What would interest me is why React? Do you have a lot of components that need instant refreshing? Why not Vue? Why not Vanilla JS or turbolinks? Give me some food for thought.

> We recently raised $#{amount} from top investors.

I've been through several raising funds. And I know this is the moment shit usually starts to hit the fan. With big money comes big political meddlings. So, thanks, but no thanks.

I know recruiting is hard, but, don't you think it would help if:
- You'd reach out to people with "real words".
- You had anything specific to say about your product? Or your culture? Something that would not involve raising funds, a JS framework or being young.
- Target specific people you really dig instead of spraying and praying some fish will bite.

It's fun to me that recruiting usually ends up being done by either HR people or techies: two categories of people that, in my experience, are less prone to show empathy.
