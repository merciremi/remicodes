# How to wrap your head around a new codebase?

Let's say you're new to the job or you've jsut got a feature request around some parts of the codebase you don't know about. What do you do? What shouldn't you do?

## What you shouldn't do

- Knock your head on the wall for hours on end: you try to read and undrstand the code alone. But after a while, you're just not getting anywhere. Just ask for help earlier. Do not try to do everything alone.

## Some things I've put in place in my team to streamline this
The end goal is to get how things work faster, in a more comprehnsive way and get to work on that feature faster.

### What I can do on my own
- Gonna read the code I need to work around
- If things aren't clear, I'll take some notes
- If I can, I try to break down what's happening: isolate each logical part, getting a sense of what's going on, what's the app's flow, how my part fits in the whole
- If I can I'd go read some docs: i.e. Wicked gem
- this is the tipping point => this is where I either get stubborn (bad) or I ask for help

### What I can't do on my own
- I go and ask the person who's reponsible for the code:
  - I explain my previous research
  - allows me to get the big picture
  - dig deeper for edge cases
  - I love to get a walkthrough of the whole process
  - get a proper set up (api keys, credentials, etc)
- I go to my mentor/most senior person in the team: idem

### Additional steps
- I'll draw things on paper: database interaction, the flow (data, user experience)
- I'll go and check the data we have in our database: if I need to update specific values, I do and see if said values in DB are corrupted
