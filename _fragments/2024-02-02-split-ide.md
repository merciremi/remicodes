(Very) practical tip for reducing cognitive load on a complex file, where you need to make changes and check for a lot of stuff around:

- Split screen in two with the same file on the two panels.
- Left panel stays where you're actually working.
- Right panel moves around the file to find stuff.

Much better than scrolling up and down, and trying to keep what you just saw in your working memory while you're trying to find the right spot to make changes.

Some answers from folks:
