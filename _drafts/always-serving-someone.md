Currently working on a legacy application to migrate stuff over a new version of the app.
- circumvulated code
- abstracts pilling up like russian dolls
- all this to do very little
- spend infinite time to understand what everything does

This bit of code is a massive cost center.

I've taking the time to have my code as expressive and litterate a spossible.
- this is serving myself and my fellow devs
- we are our own customer
- move away from the "after me the deluge" mindeset "i won't be touching that part of the app for ever"

devs can have that feeling that they are not in the work of delivering a great service. They code stuff. They think about tech in terms of challenge, speed, fancyness. But what about a broader sense? Work on problems, find solutions. Designers.

In my job, I'm not delivering directly to our end users. I get data from the database and send it over the front end teams. I could say that I don't care about customers. They're not my problem anymore (as long as I deliver my data fast enough and robustly enough). But waht about myself? Am I not my own cutomer?

By taking extra steps to to make great code, write beautiful and useful code, I create a lot of value : time gained now and over time (compounds!).

Cost center --> value center

Even if we ain't shipping for end users, we always serve a customers. And I want to serve 'em well.
