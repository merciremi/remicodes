For the past 15 years, I've had multiple encounters with the systemic violence baked in our mainstream work culture: bullying, harassment, sexism, racism, etc.

I've spent countless hours talking about these heart-breaking situations with friends, layers, psychologists, and work inspectors. All are witnessing a shitstorm that is destroying people from all horizons.

All companies indulge to it: big corps, public services, NGOs, etc. It's everywhere. Even in those over-hyped companies called startups.

I don't know if we've all been there, but I have. And I refuse to feel guilty about it. I refuse to wear those traumas as a stigma.

I want people to speak up about being abused. I want people to speak to each other about being abused.

Because talking about it - even if some people will tell you off for it - will often put strangers on your path that'll help you get through it. Silence is playing the game of violence. Silence is dying (by accepting your disappearance; literally or symbolically). Talking is bonding and organizing. Talking is living.

A while back, [@ronsoak](https://dev.to/ronsoak) published a great post on dev.to about the [lies we tell ourselves that can lead to burnout](https://dev.to/ronsoak/the-lies-and-lack-of-self-respect-that-lead-to-burnout-5007). It stroke me that many of these lies are a by-product of this dominant work culture where:
- people are resources (even worse, a `load` on companies account books) to be burnt through
- passion is leveraged to squeeze people of their every drop
- words are emptied of their meaning to suspend our disbelief

Something I often hear when someone first tells me about being abused at work is <mark>that it's their fault if they're being bullied.</mark>

So let me add another lie our work culture tries to make us believe:

<mark>It's not okay to be bullied at work.</mark>
☝️ Print it and glue it on your cubicle.

This bullying can range from casual to overtly aggressive:

- you and your work are being "gently" mock by other team members regularly
- you are left out of discussions because of your gender/sexual orientation/ethnicity...
- you are told you're not left out of these discussions because of your gender/sexual orientation/ethnicity but because of [insert shitty excuse here].
- you're are threatened (orally or in writing)
- sticks and carrots all the time
- you're never doing enough

If you feel sick going to work or if you keep thinking about your teammates' remarks when you're home chilling (or worse, sleeping), don't tell yourself it's normal. Or that you're being a wuss. You're not and you're probably being abused.

What can we do? We can and should learn to defend ourselves if we have to stay in this working culture. Or we can try to find another way of working.
