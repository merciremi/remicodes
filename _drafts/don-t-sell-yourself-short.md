title: Don't sell yourself short
---

Imagine yourself back to the interview table. You've just graduated from university. Or you've just done a coding bootcamp. Maybe you're in your first two years as a developer.

You are, what the market calls, a junior developer.

Now, you know there's this strong belief that <mark>junior developers are a burden to their employer</mark>. It's on everyone's lips. It's on the recruiter's who's sitting in front of you. It's on your lips too.

Nobody knows why. But everybody's droning on about it.

Well, this is bullshit. And you're in for a raw deal.

Let's go through common fallacies, their underlying mechanisms - conscious or unconscious -, and how to fend them off.

## "The market is tough right now" and other fallacies

When I started looking for my first gig, many developers told me it'd be difficult.

> The market is tough right now.

> Companies don't hire junior developers like they used to.

> Teams want fake juniors: technically skilled, battle-tested, unwilling to properly negotiate their comp package.

At first, I didn't pay attention to these. But after a few weeks of meeting people, I started to have second thoughts. After all:
- I'd never had a job title remotely related to coding.
- I was super picky about the team I'd joined.
- I have polarizing opinions (_albeit_ diplomatically expressed) and, I say "fuck" a lot.

The more interviews I did, the more I felt like a burden to everyone:

> We'd be investing a lot of money hiring a junior developer. We wouldn't expect any return on that investment for the next 3 years.

(Note how they just - unsuccessfully - tried to talked me into not asking a raise for three freaking years?)

Then, out of all these sentences, one struck me as my escape route:

> Since you're a junior developer and have limited skills, we'd give you $some_amount per annum.

This is was my 'aha' moment! ðŸ’¡

What changed? I realized that companies were only assessing my value out of my technical skills. My previous 15-ish years in the workforce were completely overlooked and I was framed as a complete tenderfoot - [something I couldn't accept](https://daedtech.com/junior-developer-never-accept/){:target="\_blank"}.

I decided to push back, [own my story]({{site.baseurl}}/own-your-story/), bring attention to my full skill set, and move from the cost centers ("We'd be investing a lot of money hiring a junior developer.") to the profit centers ("Sure, come on work with us and take our money. Please?").

<blockquote>
  You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you.

## Show it or it doesn't exist

Here's a list of my non-tech skills and how they affect on a daily basis my technical work.

### Writing

### Design

### Craftmanship

### 15-ish career

### Entrepreneurship

I can already hear the "But Remi, I don't have any skills." Well, let me prove you wrong friend.

Make time in your agenda (a couple of hours at least). Grab some paper and pen. You're ready?

Now, I want you to make a list of every fucking job you've done in your life. Next to each job, list every task you've ever done and what you learnt from them.

Worked in a pizza parlor? You've probably learnt a lot about diplomacy, toxic managers, and being client-facing. So write it.

Did an intership? Write it.

Got the garbage out for years at your parents house? Write it.

Worked on a piece of software instead of getting a CS degree? Write it.

Write everything. First, this will give you a masterlist of your skills that you can return to. Secondly, when someone'll tells you that you know nothing, it'll remind you that they're wrong (if only Jon Snow had made such a list).

## A real-life example: how a performance review showed me the size of the bacon I bring home






Some of the skills unrelated to tech and what they do on my code/tech production:
- writing:
  - express myself, in code, i look for expressionful yet concise names for methods
  - my code is expressive, articulated, easy to understand
- librarian:
  - taxonomy in OOP
- stained-glass + being traumatised by former manager for 4 years:
  - love of shipping
  - attention to details and well-made things
- 15 years of working life
  - easyness to work with diff people, diff situation
- design:
  - ability to listen to people, put myself into their shoes, find solutions for them
  - deconstruct problems to first principles and work from there
  - build bridges and take inspiration from anywhere
- entrepreneur:
  - know how to talk to bosses - as calvin said, we speak the same langue but not the same language.

- some numbers :
  - an expert sells a property
  - features i directly coded shaved X hours per year per property
  - means more than X hours
  - means that i directly make the company reduce its costs by more than X times my salary
  - add to this the fact that i indirectly help reduce stress, mental load, errors, negligencies, etc. : this is tough to compute because the causal relationship is more tenuous and harder to fingerpoint. But you could estimate that the costs reduced are of an order of magnitude to my salary
















Fallacies > underlining ideas / conscious unconscious / reply
Skills you bring to the table
Real life example


- common fallacies
- what does this mean for you: getting a raw deal
- fight back: skills to bring to the table
- a real life example
- be judged by your work


> A non-junior dev has a reputation that helps convince employers.

And this is exactly what my point is: maybe you're a junior dev with superb skills, maybe you're just average. Let the work you produce be the yardstick by which your value is assessed after a few months. But don't let a potentially unexact fallacy blights your prospects from the get-go.

> I feel that "junior" developers also help improve the code base. Because it becomes the best interest of the team to make the code more readable, less clever, and to document things. This helps everyone, not just the new dev.

> I think that's intentional. Companies want to pay you as little as possible and get the most value out of you as possible. One way to do that is to call it a 'junior' level job.





















All this reflects into my code, my presence, my interpersonal skills. and this brings a lot of value to the company.
