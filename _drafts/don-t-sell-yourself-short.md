title: don't sell yourself short
---

Imagine yourself back to the interview table. You've just graduated from university. Or you've just done a coding bootcamp. Maybe you're in your first two years as a developer.

You are, what the market calls, a junior developer.

Now, you know there's this strong belief that <mark>junior developers are a burden to their employer</mark>. It's on everyone's lips. It's on the recruiter's who's sitting in front of you. It's on your lips too.

Nobody knows why. But everybody's droning on about it.

Well, this is bullshit. And you're in for a raw deal.


- common fallacies
- what does this mean for you: getting a raw deal
- fight back: skills to bring to the table
- a real life example
- be judged by your work



> A non-junior dev has a reputation that helps convince employers.

And this is exactly what my point is: maybe you're a junior dev with superb skills, maybe you're just average. Let the work you produce be the yardstick by which your value is assessed after a few months. But don't let a potentially unexact fallacy blights your prospects from the get-go.

> I feel that "junior" developers also help improve the code base. Because it becomes the best interest of the team to make the code more readable, less clever, and to document things. This helps everyone, not just the new dev.

> I think that's intentional. Companies want to pay you as little as possible and get the most value out of you as possible. One way to do that is to call it a 'junior' level job.

## "The market is tough right now" and other fallacies

When I started looking for my first gig, everyone told me it'd be difficult.

<blockquote>
  The market is tough right now.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Companies don't hire junior developers like they used to.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Teams want fake juniors: technically skilled, let's-talk-money n00bs.
</blockquote>

If truth be told, I too thought it'd be hard:
- I'd never had a job title remotely related to coding.
- I was super picky about the team I'd joined.
- I have polarizing opinions (albeit diplomatically expressed) and, I say "fuck" a lot.

And during the first few weeks of meeting people, I heard a lot of these. One specifically stroke me:

<blockquote>
  We'd be investing a lot of money hiring someone with your limited skills. We wouldn't expect any return on investment for the next 3 years.
</blockquote>

The first thought that crossed my mind was:

<blockquote>Well, that's convenient. You've just prevented me from asking a raise for 3 years.</blockquote>

After a while, I decided to push back against those pervasive falsehoods and [own my story]({{site.baseurl}}/own-your-story/).

I stood by my technical skills that were just fine for my experience and that my other skills would bring much much more to the table than believed.

## Bring your skills to the table

## A real-life example of creating value






























When i first started looking for a job as a developer, everyone told me that it'd be tough, that companies were not hiring as much devs as they did before, that they wanted fake juniors (lods of skills, several years of experiences, not too hungry for decent compensation packages).

And during those first few weeks of job hunting, I thought they were right. I got so much shit for being a bootcamper that I was [loosing my nerve](lien vers own your story).

I too heard the "We'd be investing a lot of money hiring someone with your limited skills. We wouldn't expect any return for the next 3 years". Note how this is convenient for a company: they just made you accept the fact that you won't be able to negotiate a better package for the next 3 years.

But I defended that my technical skills were just fine for my experience and that my other skills would bring much much more to the table than believed

I believe in value more than just money. But many employers just stuck to this one point. So I'll paraphrase pation11 about this.

If you're in one of these categories, you're creating value : make money (sales person), reduce costs. Otherwise, you're just a line in the "cost" column.

  You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you.

Some of the skills unrelated to tech and what they do on my code/tech production:
- writing:
  - express myself, in code, i look for expressionful yet concise names for methods
  - my code is expressive, articulated, easy to understand
- librarian:
  - taxonomy in OOP
- stained-glass + being traumatised by former manager for 4 years:
  - love of shipping
  - attention to details and well-made things
- 15 years of working life
  - easyness to work with diff people, diff situation
- design:
  - ability to listen to people, put myself into their shoes, find solutions for them
- entrepreneur:
  - know how to talk to bosses - as calvin said, we speak the same langue but not the same language.

- some numbers :
  - an expert sells a property
  - features i directly coded shaved X hours per year per property
  - means more than X hours
  - means that i directly make the company reduce its costs by more than X times my salary
  - add to this the fact that i indirectly help reduce stress, mental load, errors, negligencies, etc. : this is tough to compute because the causal relationship is more tenuous and harder to fingerpoint. But you could estimate that the costs reduced are of an order of magnitude to my salary



















Imagine yourself during an interview. You've recently graduated. May you're in your first couple of years as a developer. You're, what's called, a junior. The person in front of you is listing all the good reasons why they should pay you less than what you're asking:
- you're a junior
- we're investing on you and can't expect a return before 3 years (note how they stole your cability to negociate for the next three years)
- you're technical skills are shit

Well, let me break the news for you: all of this is just a shitload of crap.

There's this belief that junior developers are a burden to their company. It's in every employer's mouth. It's in developers' mouth too.

Well,

There's this common fallacy, that a junior


When you're staring out as a junior developer, there's this fallacy that you're costing a lot to companies. Well, let me break it for you. That's not (necesseraly) true.



- pitch: even when u'r a junior, you bring more value to the table than the market wants you to believe

- When i first started looking for a job as a developer, everyone told me that it'd be tough, that companies were not hiring as much devs as they did before, that they wanted fake juniors (lods of skills, not too hungry for decent compensation packages)
- i also got the talk about i was a junior dev and lacked technical skills
- i defended that my technical skills were just fine for my experience and that my other skills would bring much much more to the table than believed

I believe in value more than just money. But many employers just stuck to this one point. So I'll paraphrase pation11 about this.

- but when the market talks to you, you're a "cost" or a "burden" as a junior dev. They need to invest in you for three year before reapping the fruits of this sacrifice. (cf marc de drivy)

All this reflects into my code, my presence, my interpersonal skills. and this brings a lot of value to the company.
