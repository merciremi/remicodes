title: 2019 - a year in review
---

Well, here we are. December has come and gone. Now is the time to look back on what happened last year - and to brew some mulled wine.

## Taking care of my internet garden

After writing sporadically for years, I've been itching to write more. And so I did! What changed? Well, I learned how to build software and ship things. As it turns out, it's easier to write about something you enjoy doing day in day out.

I also decided to write for my pleasure rather than for the whole _build an audience_ nonsense. I'm mostly writing for myself, not to pursue any metrics. That's why there are no analytics, no SEO optimization, no engagement hacks (and let me tell you that I know quite a lot about those) on my website.

Relaunching my own corner of the web would have not been possible without the tremendous help (unbeknown to her) of Tania Rascia's fantastic tutorial on setting up Jekyll](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/). So thank you, Tania.

My first post was an [introduction to time complexity]({{site.baseurl}}/wtf-time-complexity/). Not something I thought I'd ever write about! But after being tasked to compute the time complexity of an algorithm during a technical test, I thought I'd share this fancy knowledge with the world.

Some other technical stuff I've written this year:
- [An introduction to the keyword self]({{site.baseurl}}/your-new-friend-self)
- [How to use railway-oriented business transactions to unclutter Rails controllers]({{site.baseurl}}/transactions-in-rails/)
- [Testing railway-oriented business transactions with Rspec]({{site.baseurl}}/testing-business-transactions-in-rails/)

The technical post I'm the proudest of is my [beginners' introduction to Ruby classes and objects]({{site.baseurl}}/beginners-introduction-to-ruby-classes-objects/).

Now, if I'm honest, my favourite posts are those about life and how it sometimes sucks. I've come to accept that sharing shitty moments is okay and that other people can relate. It's also okay to reclaim and feel empowered by our struggles.

One of my struggles, in early 2019, was to [own my story as a mid-thirty new developer]({{site.baseurl}}/own-your-story/) and not trying to fake being a Real Developerâ„¢ (i.e. someone with a CS background and years of expertise).

I also wanted to share [my own stories about systemic violence in our mainstream work culture]({{site.baseurl}}/the-violence-within/) and how it can be fought back to some extent through the act of talking.

These two posts alone sparked a lot of conversations with folks. They also remind me why I love writing: to share stories (however they look), and not to build a personal brand.

I'll try to write more about stuff unrelated to tech this year. Some topics I care about: redefining our relationship to work, degrowing (the infamous _dÃ©croissance_), unlearning mainstream masculinity, feminism, rape culture, raising kids, building things with your hands, etc.

Also on my list of things I'd enjoy writing: a wiki or personal garden, laying out my values, shorter notes (or logs) both in French and English. We'll see.

## My first year as a Real Developerâ„¢

2019 was the year I got my first gig as a developer. And to be honest, I've felt like a fish in the water.

There is so much to learn that my curiosity is always satisfied. I've been able to work in a calm environment, to feel safe enough to ask stupid questions ALL OF THE TIME, and to enjoy autonomy and flexibility.

The results:
- a learning curve steeper than most startups' growth while being able to completely disconnect when shutting down my computer.
- I've been able to do my best work and create substantial value for the company I work for (I can't go into any specifics, but let's say it's **a lot compared to the market perceived value of a junior developer**).

Everybody's happy.

### Some newbie vanity metrics

- I've opened \~170 pull requests...
- amounting to \~450 commits.
- I've also added \~110 tests (which is ðŸ™Œ).

### What was really really cool

One of the biggest challenges was to get comfortable with a new market (real estate) and an existing codebase while getting comfortable with the basics of Ruby and Rails.







I felt a better grasp on the basics of the languages after a few months. I didn't need to check the documentation as often. Some things became automatisms. So, that's cool. Handling simple migrations, basic syntax, querying things, relationships between objects... I can now look for stuff in a more efficient way.

Learning the codebase was sometimes harder. Some bits were easier to grasp than other. Especially when I didn't had sufficient knowledge of Rails. For instance, we have some controllers with steps handle by Wicked. The syntax got me some headaches (and still are so far). There were also shit tons of new stuff to learn: testing with Rspec, using railway oriented transactions, a way of building abstractions, etc.

After nine months of intense testing, I now feel like I'm getting my first low hanging fruits out of Rspec. I can now draft a test suite more rapidly. But more importantly, I leverage tests by digging out bugs in my code, or codesmells. And that, my friends, is a great feeling.

### Some stuff I'm the proudest of
