title: 2019 - a year in review
---

Well, here we are. Winter is upon us and now is the time to look back on what happened this past year - and to brew some mulled wine.

2019 has been a tremendous year, both personnally and professionaly.

## Taking care of my internet garden

After writing sporadically for years, I've been feeling the urge to write more. And so I did! What changed? Well, I stopped working in marketing and learned how to code. It turns out, it's easier to write about what you learn when you feel proud of the work you do day in day out.

I also decided to drop entirelly the whole _build an audience_ nonsense when writing. No analytics on this website, no comments, no SEO optimisation, etc. Just writing about stuff for myself, to keep track of things. No so much of a blog, but more a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

I relaunched this corner of the web early January. And this would not have been possible without the (unknown to her) help of [Tania Rascia's fantastic tutorial on setting up Jekyll](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/). So thank you Tania.

My first post was an [introduction to time complexity]({{site.baseurl}}/wtf-time-complexity/). Pfew! Something I wrote after a harduous technical test for talent.io where I learnt a lot (even though I didn't get the job). So I decided to use this newly acquired knowledge and share it with fellow n00bs.

Some other technical stuff, I've written this year:
- [An introduction to self]({{site.baseurl}}/your-new-friend-self)
- [How to use railway-oriented business transactions to unclutter Rails controllers]({{site.baseurl}}/transactions-in-rails/)
- [Testing railway-oriented business transactions with Rspec]({{site.baseurl}}/testing-business-transactions-in-rails/)

One technial article I'm the proudest of is my [beginners' introduction to Ruby classes and objects]({{site.baseurl}}/beginners-introduction-to-ruby-classes-objects/). This one gave me a lot of pouring over. I can't thank Nicolas, Sylvain and all the other kind people who gave me feedback and/or kind words.

But, to be honest, I think my favourite posts - the ones I believe to be the most useful and essentials - are the one about life. I've also started to accept the fact that sharing our stories even though they are (sometimes) dark and full of terrors can be relate to others.

I'm glad I shared [how owning my story]({{site.baseurl}}/own-your-story/) got me through tough times. And also [how systemic violence in our mainstream work culture can be fought through talking]({{site.baseurl}}/the-violence-within/). These two posts alone have got me talk to people about their own shit and how to get through them. It also reminds me to write about what I feel like writing and not to act, pose or brand myself.







2019 has been quite a year, both personally and professionaly.
