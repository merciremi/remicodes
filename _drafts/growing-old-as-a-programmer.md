I'll be 40 next year, and I've started to wonder about what my professional life will be in the next two decades. Not a lot of 60-year old developers, hey?

[I've started working some twenty years ago]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/) and I feel I need to plan - albeit very loosely - for the future. Building software is still very new to me. I'd like to keep working at it for some time, but I don't really know how to make this job grow with me.

  <img class='regular box-shadowed' src="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/2023/12/growing-old-as-a-developer-remi-mercier-toot.png" alt="a screenshot of a Mastodon toot with me asking: I've been wondering a lot about aging in software development. Any > 40-year old developers out there that'd like to share their perspective? How did you grow (technically, managing, etc...)? Picked up fields over others (embeded systems over web app, for instance)?">
</figure>

So I shared my angst with folks on Mastodon. Turns out, there are a handful (**\*hem\***) of older programmers and many were kind enough to share their experience.

This post is a collection of conclusions sorted within loose categories.

## Learn how to learn

<blockquote>
  Students keep asking me, "What languages, tools, and libraries should I learn, for a career in software development?"
  <br>
  And really, most of those that I use daily and am an expert in did not even exist when I was in college.
  <br>
  So you need to learn to learn.
  <br>
  Learn to change.

<blockquote>
  Technical skills become obsolete. Human skills stay relevant but people, values and norms change so you have to relearn them too.

  Keep learning, keep learning keep learning.

## Translate business needs into software

<blockquote>
  Being able to talk to stakeholders and convert their input into software is by far my most valued skill.

## Focus on a field/area

<blockquote>
  I've been able to center my continuous learning around my core area of expertise: geospatial.
  <br>
  From there and a willingness to learn and a love of solving problems, I've been able to pick up Python, SQL, front-end web, and even dabble in Powershell.

## Accept trade-offs

<blockquote>
  I took jobs that let me support my family and be a participating parent. That's pretty much it.

## Learn how (and double down on) collaborate

<blockquote>
  The second most valuable is learning to work collaboratively as part of a team. We can't have expertise in everything we touch, which means we need teamwork and coordination.

## Move to management

<blockquote>
  I switched to management a couple of years ago. New things to learn!
  <br>
  Am still keeping up with technical knowledge, am still doing pro bono projects, but I must admit that my enthusiasm for learning a new programming language, paradigm, technique, library every couple of years is dwindling.
