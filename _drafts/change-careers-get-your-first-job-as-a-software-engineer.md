title: 'Change careers: get your first job as a software engineer'
---

Bridge the technical gap between your learnings (in bootcamp) and your first professional development gig.

First job: can't be super selective, money is meh.

Getting the second job means more money, better work condition, a bit more selective about the gig. You're not a total noob anymore, so people tend to trust you more.

To find that second job, you gotta start right when you're in the middle of the first one. ANticipation is key.

## How to max out progression in your first gig

- Organization to max out progression.
- Don't only rely on tickets and features.
- Many ways to do this, but here what I did. Pick your favourite:
  - Spent a lot of time asking/badgering senior developers to explain the product / their code to me
  - As an alternative, when you don't have any senior people: pair prog and build in public. Streams, screen casts, asking on Twitter/private communities, etc. Got a lot of answers and help this way. Example of Zoé.
- Writing about your learnings. When working on something cool, i take notes about the topic during work. I "just" have to reword things later to create a cool post.
- Read a book on coding.
- Should I keep tabs on my industry during work or outside of work. Your employers will tell you to do it on your own time, but I think that a reasonable amount of work time can be dedicated to this. Anything that helps you learn new techniques and be better at your job will tricle down your company.Requires organization and focus. Let's say, friday afternoon are often boring. No energy. Boom, you do that now. It's an investment on your skills.
So sure you can do it on your personal time, but I think people with different hobbies, that keep time to do something else than work-related hobbies are better in their baskets.

## Structure your knowledge / learning
- I like to write posts about what I learn (that's probably why you're here too)
- At the very beginning, I was keeping threads on my Today I Learned. Voir aussi Ségolène
- I tried streaming and screencast, but I find it harder, mostly because I'm super focused on my French accent.

Anything that allows you to zoom back from programming and reflect on what you learnt, articulate your knowledge, dig deeper on some stuff you didn't understand.

I also strongly believe in learning by teaching.

## Understand the market

First job: can't be super selective, money is meh. You do what you can.

Second job is another story. With a couple of years under of your belt, things change. You get emails more frequently.

So when you start getting a bit of experience, it's good to get a better grasp of the job market. What are the demand and supply like.

Many devs, like other jobers, don't talk about their salary and their comp packages. When you are the first to talk about it, people tend to open up more. It allows you to get a comprehensive vision of your worth, what you can ask for, in your second job. This also applies to all your work life I guess.

You can also ask people who work at the company you wanna work with. I once had the salaries of half the company even before working there.

Talking and exchanging information is a good way to unionize in a way, to get better comp packages, but also working on better projects, get a 4-day work-week, etc.

A good way to talk w/ peeps is live, but also trhough communities (Discord, slack, etc.)

## Boost your klout

Remember klout? The scoring plateform for web influencers?

Well, boosting your klout makes a reaaaaal difference in the conversation you have with potential employers.
