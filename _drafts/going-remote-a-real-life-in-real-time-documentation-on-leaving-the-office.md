title: 'going remote: a real-life in real time documentation on leaving the office'
---

Last week, I've announced to my teamates @hosman that I would be going full remote next July.

I want to keep a updated documentation on the process of going full remote. This'll include:
- my own transition
- the transition within the company:
  - what goes well
  - the blocking points / the fears
  - hypothesis on how to remove the above
  - results

Here's a rough bucket list on what needs to be done:

- Take decision ✅
- Talk to my lead developer, Thibault. ✅
- Talk to my CTO, Benjamin. ✅
- Gather a first decision from owners about yes/no in principle: due date mid-march
  - if yes, discuss modalities
  - if no, discuss leaving modalities
- Remote Modalities
  - if yes, paperwork
  - if no, discuss leaving modalities
- Set up processes and tools
- Leave
