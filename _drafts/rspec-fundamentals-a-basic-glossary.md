This post is part of a larger series about RSpec fundamentals. If you haven't read the first part - [how to setup RSpec and name files and, digging into their basic structure]({{site.baseurl}}/rspec-101-basic-set-up/), go and read it, I'll wait.

Done? Let's move on to our second instalment!

In this second part, I want to explore the methods you'll use the most when testing with RSpec.

We'll build an example test for a `User` model. I'll explain key concepts and keywords along the way.

## Describe your abstraction with `describe`

We've already dig into the inner workings of `describe` in the first post. So I'll just sum up the idea behind it.

> `describe` is used to group your tests around a common abstraction: a class, a request, etc. It's a wrapper to build an example group.

Since methods are an abstraction, you usually nest several `describe`s in your example group. Let's test an instance method - `#full_name`.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    describe '#full_name' do
      # test the output of the method full_name
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, the first `describe` is called on the module `RSpec` and _describes_ the `User` class. <mark>This is the top-level example group</mark>. The second `describe` is called within our top-level example group and describes the method `#full_name`.

The second `describe` is nested in the first one. Both describe _something_: a class, a method.

The emphasis on _"something"_ here is important. We'll get back to it when we talk about `context`.

Note how the second `describe` takes a string as an argument. The string is the description of the abstraction your testing. As a rule of thumb, when testing a method, keep the description to the name of the method. Prefix it with a hash or a dot based on the scope of the method:
- `describe '#instance_method_name'` for instance methods
- `describe '.class_method_name'` for class methods

When you run your tests, RSpec will output your descriptions like this:

{% highlight zsh %}
  Randomized with seed 4321

  User
    #full_name
{% endhighlight %}

Once we write tests, RSpec will output more details.

## Declare your abstraction with `subject` (and named subject)

`subject` represents the abstraction you're testing. Your subject can be a method, a request, a serialized object, etc. In our example, it's the method `#full_name`.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    describe '#full_name' do
      subject { user.full_name }
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

`subject` is a method that takes a block in which I call the method `#full_name` on an instance of `User`.

What's the difference between `subject` and `describe` then? Well, `subject` tells RSpec what to evaluate. `describe` is just the description for your tests to be readable by fellow humans.

Sometimes, you need to explicitly reference your subject in your tests (we'll see an example in a little while). In that case, it's best to name your subject.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    describe '#full_name' do
      subject(:full_name_method) { user.full_name }
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Here `full_name_method` will reference the output of the `#full_name` method in our tests. I've chosen a crappy name - `full_name_method` - to highlight the difference between the name of the subject, and the actual execution of the method code.

Why the `User` class is not the subject to our whole example group? Are we not testing the model `User`? You're absolutely right. We _are_ testing the `User` class but you can't test the class as a whole. So you test each part, each behavior, until they sum up to your class. Each behavior is a different test subject. This is why RSpec advertise themselves as _behavior driven development_.

But hang on! In our example, where does that `user.full_name` comes from? Let me show you.

## Creating variables with `let` and `let!`

`let` is specific to RSpec. It's the method that let's you create variable.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    let(:user) { User.create(first_name: 'Buffy', last_name: 'Summers') }

    describe '#full_name' do
      subject(:full_name_method) { user.full_name }
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Here, we create a user and assign it to the variable `user`.

But why don't we just use a good old `user = User.create`? We could get rid of those `:` and `{}`!

Technically, you can. This is valid code and your tests will be able to access the value store in `user`.

But `let` is not just a way to assign values to variables.

First, `let` is lazy-evaluated. It means - in our example - that the user won't be created and assigned until the variable `user` is invoked for the first time in your tests. Second, `let` is a memoized helper method. Once the value is evaluated for the first time, it won't be evaluated again. It's value is cached accross the example group. In our example above, `user` is evaluated once and its value is cached accross all examples because `let(:user)` is defined at the top-level example group (the `RSpec.define` block)[^1].

If you want to forece the evaluation of `User.create` before your tests use your variable `user`, use `let!` instead. This is useful when you need to create several instances as a context for your tests.

To recap:
- `let(:user) { ... }` is only evaluated the first time a test calls the variable `user`.
- `let!(:user) { ... }` is evaluated before each test.

### Other variables

In your test, you can also access the variable `described_class` which represent the core abstraction of your spec file. In our case, this is the `User` class.

### Contextual `let`

You often need to change the value of variables based on some context. Here's an example:

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    let(:user) { User.create(first_name: first_name, last_name: last_name) }

    describe '#full_name' do
      let(:first_name) { 'Buffy' }
      let(:last_name) { 'Summers' }
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Here, `user` is still accessible everywhere, but `first_name: 'Buffy'` and `last_name: 'Summers'` are only accessible within the context of the `#full_name` example group.

This allows you to change the value when you need it. Speaking of context, let's check it out.

## Test conditionnal behavior with `context`

`context` is sometimes best understood with an example. Let me show you something before I give you a definition.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    let(:user) { User.create(first_name: 'Buffy', last_name: 'Summers') }

    describe '#full_name' do
      subject { user.full_name }

      context 'when a user has a first_name and a last_name' do
        # test the output of the method full_name under a specific constraint
      end

      context 'when a user has no last_name' do
        # test the output of the method full_name under another constraint
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Can you guess what `context` does?

> `context` is used to group your tests around - drum roll ü•Å - a specific context.

I know, it sounds silly when you spell it out.

If you expect a different output for your method `#full_name` based on a condition - a blank last name for example - you can group your tests in several `context` blocks.

Some examples of contexts you'll use in your tests:
- What happens if an attribute is `nil` when I expected a truthy value?
- What happens if my input's type is different from the one I expected?
- What happens when method raises an error? And when it doesn't?

Here's what the output of your tests look like with some contexts.

{% highlight zsh %}
  Randomized with seed 4321

  User
    #full_name
      when a user has a first_name and a last_name
        ...
      when a user has no last_name
        ...

{% endhighlight %}

### When to use `describe` and when to use `context`

To be honest, when I first started testing, I would use `describe` and `context` indifferently. Then after a while, I set into a pattern:

- When I test _something_ - a class, a method, an abstraction -, I use `describe`.
- When I test _how that something fare under a certain circumstance_ - a missing parameter, an `nil` value, etc -, I use `context`.

## Describe your test with `it`

We're getting there! But before we write the _actual_ content of our first test, we need to describe it first. And this is what `it` does. As `describe` is a wrapper to build an example group, `it` is a wrapper to build an example. `it`takes a string as argument.

The description of each test should state the expected behavior of the the abstraction you're testing.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    let(:user) { User.create(first_name: 'Buffy', last_name: 'Summers') }

    describe '#full_name' do
      subject { user.full_name }

      context 'when a user has a first_name and a last_name' do
        it "returns the user's full name" do
          # test expected behaviour
        end
      end

      context 'when a user has no last_name' do
        it "returns an error" do
          # test the expected behaviour
        end
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

For each `context`, I expect a specific output. `it` makes it clear what I should get out of my abstraction.

RSpec will print out your `it`s in your console.

{% highlight zsh %}
  Randomized with seed 4321

  User
    #full_name
      when a user has a first_name and a last_name
        returns the user's full name
      when a user has no last_name
        returns an error

{% endhighlight %}

See? This is super easy to read. You are testing the instance method `full_name` defined in your class `User`. When your instance of `User` has a first name and last name defined, you expect your method to return your user's full name. When your user has not last name, you expect your method to raise an error.

And now, it's time to write the core of our first test, our expectation.

## What did you `expect`?

RSpec is behavior-based. It allows your to test the _expected_ behaviors of your abstraction (i.e. your `subject`).

You `expect` your test's `subject` to equal / contain / include your expected output. Let me show you.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    let(:user) { User.create(first_name: 'Buffy', last_name: 'Summers') }

    describe '#full_name' do
      subject { user.full_name }

      context 'when a user has a first_name and a last_name' do
        it "returns the user's full name" do
          expect(subject).to eq("Buffy Summers")
        end
      end

      context 'when a user has no last_name' do
        it "returns an error" do
          expect(subject).to raise_error(UserErrors::InvalidLastName)
        end
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

`expect` takes your `subject` as an argument and return an `ExpectationTarget` object with the actual result of your abstraction evaluation stored in it. Then `expect` calls the method `.to` with a _matcher_ as an argument. in our example, `eq` and `raise_error` are matchers. These matchers take an argument too: the expected output.

The matchers' job is to compare the expected output with the actual output. Here's the [code from RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/blob/main/lib/rspec/matchers/built_in/eq.rb#L34){:target="\_blank"}, it's pretty straighforward:

{% highlight ruby %}
  module RSpec
    module Matchers
      module BuiltIn
        class Eq < BaseMatcher
          # ...

          private

          def match(expected, actual)
            actual == expected
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

If your expectation is fullfilled, your example's description will print out green. If the expectation is not fullfilled, it'll output red.

Before we conclude, let list the basic expectations and matchers from RSpec.

### Basic expectations and matchers

Expectations' job is mostly to create an `ExpectationTarget` object that responds to `.to` or `to_not`. These allow you to create positive expectations or negative ones. This is also where RSpec handle specific examples, like aggregate failures (i.e. you test several assertions in one example[^2]).

You can write your expectation in three ways:

{% highlight ruby %}
  # spec/models/user_spec.rb

  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
    let(:user) { User.create(first_name: 'Buffy', last_name: 'Summers') }

    describe '#full_name' do
      subject { user.full_name }

      it "returns the user's full name" do
        expect(subject).to eq("Buffy Summers")
      end

      it { expect(subject).to eq("Buffy Summers") }

      it { is_expected.to eq("Buffy Summers") }
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

RSpec generates its own message when your write `it { expect(subject).to ... }`. `is_expected` triggers the evaluation of your subject implicitly and returns an RSpec message.

You can dive into [expectations in the RSpec codebase](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/tree/main/lib/rspec/expectations){:target="\_blank"}.

Matchers are a powerful feature. They allow you to define specific matching rules between your actual output and your expected output:

- `eq` does a simple comparison.
- `contain_exactly` checks if every arguments passed to your matcher are contain in your actual result regardless of order.
- `include` checks is the argument passed to your matcher is included in your result.
- `have_http_status` is damn useful for testing requests' responses.

You can discover all matchers [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/tree/main/lib/rspec/matchers/built_in

[^1]: This the context which encapsulates all your tests for the class `User`.
[^2]: This is pretty useful for testing attributes in a serialized object.
