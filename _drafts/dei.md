title: The never-ending days of DEI's importance
---

A few weeks back, the creator of Ruby on Rails wrote a pamphlet rejoicing on - what appears to him as - the waning days of DEI's dominance.

I'll be honest my first reaction was to dunk on DHH. But a bazillion people did that already, so my thirst for name-calling was already quenched.

I decided to scrap the _great_ title I had initially written for this post[^1], and engage in a more boring write-up about how diversity, equity, and inclusion were, are, and will always be essential to workers.

Disclaimer: I was a _fan_ of 37signals for a long time. I've read every post ever written on their blog. I've listened to all their podcasts. I promoted their work philosophy within the companies I worked for. So you know where I come from.

Let's hit it.

## DEI is not something new

<blockquote>
  The acronym for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion entered the common corporate lexicon with overwhelming force in 2020.
  <cite>DHH</cite>
</blockquote>

The corporate world might have pretended to look the other way for centuries, but **people who do not hold the keys to the castle have long gathered together to gain better leverage against the people who _do_ hold the keys**.

Think of the British mid-18th century with the fight against nascent proletarianization, the French _Front Populaire_ which fought for the first paid vacations in 1936, or the 1960s civil rights movements in the US. Think of Amazon workers forming unions in 2021 who gathered support from progressive tech CTOs.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fingers crossed for this drive to unionize Amazon warehouse workers ü§û‚ù§Ô∏è <a href="https://t.co/QEpo47x9Hb">https://t.co/QEpo47x9Hb</a></p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1376544493009301513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

DEI stems from the same roots as unions.

People gather and fight for diversity because they are left out of the myth of meritocracy.

Inherently, DEI is the losers' team. It's the people whose parents could not lend them $300,000 to start a business. It's the people who could not benefit from state-sponsored upper education. It's the people who begin the race miles behind those more privileged.

I have to ask: **Can losers really dominate anything**?

Even unionized Amazon workers cannot force Jeff Bezos to share his control over Amazon with them. Social justice often works in small steps: get a $300 pay raise, exercise your legal right to take a break to go to the bathroom, or [apply for fair loans based on your revenues, not your gender](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192540900393705474). These fights are small potatoes compared to the strides the corporate world takes to accumulate power and wealth.

But if we want to level the odds we've been dealt at birth, these are necessary fights.

## Companies are social constructs too

First, companies are neither created _ex nihilo_ nor free from their creator's prejudices.

Companies inherit the behaviors and the social framework of their parent context: society. Programmers like David and I can relate to this concept of inheritance:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Company < Society
  def initialize
    super
    @goal = :profit
  end
end

class Society
  def initialize(attributes)
    @racism = attributes.dig(:history, :racism)
    @sexism = attributes.dig(:history, :sexism)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

It pains me to write it, but societies still struggle to address their systemic racism, sexism, and inequalities. Women[^2] currently experience a backlash that affects their basic rights and agency. BIPOC people are still at the wrong end of a very lousy stick.

According to Girls Who Code and Accenture (hardly a woke-riddled company): half of women leave their tech job before age 35, noninclusive culture being cited as the primary reason.

These inequalities need to be tackled at every level of society: from public institutions to the intimacy of families. And yes, in companies too.

This brings us to our second point: should not companies be held responsible for DEI?

I mean, it's hard to build a company. I know. I tried (and will do it again). You are taking risks. You are putting your money on the table. _You_ are the maverick that carries the wind of change on his dashing shoulders. Whereas those pesky workers are just taking their paychecks. They have _nothing_ to worry about.

Sure, it's a nice story.

But let me ask you: if you don't want to deal with people, why bother hiring them?

Yes, you **need** people to turn your one-person company into something that can cater to millions of people.

And if you need them, you have to make do with their demands. Just like workers make do with companies demands. These are the basics of supply and demand, really.

## Adam Smith redux

As Adam Smith could have said: It is not from the benevolence of society, its institutions, or its companies, that we expect our interests to be cared for, but from their regard to their own interest.

<blockquote>
  We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.
  <cite>Adam Smith</cite>
</blockquote>

David, why not see every person involved in DEI as your husband, your mom, your friend, the person who sits in the cube next to you? They're real PEOPLE, just like you and me[^3]. Sure, DEI committees are a pain when they ask _you_ - a person with power - to create a safe environment so they can do their best work. They're also real people - reasonable, reliable people. So why not listen to their humanity from time to time?

When you lose 30% of your workforce not listening to your people, why not RECONSIDER?

That's the problem with Adam Smith's most quoted sentence. It traps us into one behavior. As a CEO, I'll only listen to my interest. But my employees will too. And our respective interests are not always aligned.

After promoting calmer (and saner) workplaces for years, David seems genuinely abashed by tech workers leading the charge themselves.

<blockquote>
  Tech workers ‚Äì from whom the DEI movement drew its most active and engaged disciples ‚Äì no longer hold as much power over their place of employment as they once did.
  <cite>DHH</cite>
</blockquote>

Hopefully, power is dynamic. While workers - not just tech workers - might suffer from a fierce backlash by "the most fervent ideologues" of gross productivism, they're not just done yet.

Workers know the drill: a good way to elicit interest is to gain leverage. And a good way to gain leverage, is to gather. DEI committees and unions give isolated individuals more weight in the conversations. DEI is a fitting tool to pry a company open and air its inherited prejudices out. If it helps changing an organization to make it more inclusive, even better!

## A lot of mistakes will be made

<blockquote>
  [Elon Musk] acknowledged that his ongoing reorganization of the company will ‚Äúhave a lot of mistakes‚Äù but ‚Äústabilize over time.‚Äù
  <cite>The Verge</cite>
</blockquote>

Social movements are not perfect. Like any gathering of interests, some organizations lose their integrity. But what is the alternative? Leaving the drivewheel to untamed capitalists? Doesn't sound like a good idea.

DEI will make a lot of mistakes. It's a given. But is its end goal not worth them?

Remember, DEI is like vegetables. You may not like it at first, but it's good for you anyway.
