    Finally managed to create anchors for each scribble. Now I can share specific ones with friends without having them to scroll through the entire page.

    A small improvement I've stollen from [Juanitofatas' murmurs](https://juanitofatas.com/murmur){:target="\_blank"}. üôè

    Acquiring languages != learning languages

    This video describes my own path with getting intimate with the English language these past years:
    - no grammar, no corrections
    - listen to people describing simple things for you
    - talk as much as you can, to whoever you can
    - read stories you already know in your target language
    - do not focus on "learning", accept that you'll suck at it for some time

    I'm currently acquiring German that way. Ich kanne noch nicht Deutsch sprechen aber verstuche ich ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

    Some new sensations:
    - the smell of dry bamboo sticks when it rains
    - the sound of birds in the morning
    - the sound of cicadas in the afternoon
    - seeing the mountain when I look over the distance
    - walking paths barefoot
    - sourdough bread + fresh goat cheese + honey + grain coffee == joy

    I had a spare bit of solid wood table top. I decided to turn it into a console-table for my amp and turntable.

    I was able to cut all necessary pieces into that single piece of oak. Only had to buy a beech gudgeon to assemble the feet.

    I've assembled and glued the feet. Waiting for the glue to dry. Then, I'll oil everything.

    [2020-07-20 update] Glue and oil are dry. Final assembly is done. Ready for some music.

    The best career advice I've ever heard, courtesy of Jodie Whittaker's parents:

    > Whittaker says she never once suffer negativity from her family. "The only discouragement I got was from a career adviser when I was 15 who told me [acting] was a stupid idea. She said you need a back-up plan, and thank God, my mum and dad are completely adamant that that's the wrong way to go. They said 'You're only 15, you don't need a back-up plan. Get a back-up plan if it all goes pear-shaped at 30. Just go do it'. I went 'Yeah!'."

    After almost a year of leaving my website live its life, I've come back to it. I spent last week errands reading my past articles, my notes, my scribbles, etc. Everything.

    And I enjoyed it! It was a surprised for me. I thought I'd be more _blas√©_ about my own production.

    Turns out, I ended up being quite proud of what I wrote. I loved the words, the design, the articulation. I even learned a few things I had forgotten. _[Build a minimal feature flags manager in under an hour](https://remimercier.com/minimal-feature-flags-manager/)_ is one of my favorite posts from these past months.

    So sometimes, just raise your nose from the keyboard, and enjoy the work you've put out there. It's rewarding.
