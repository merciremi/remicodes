What I'm doing right now:

- Restoring a 18th century house.
- Enjoying funemployment after working remotely for 2,5 years for a book-streaming company.
- Walking and climbing the local mountains, and taking pictures along the way.
- Getting to know my new camera (Olympus XA) sent by [Yannick](https://yannickschutz.com/){:target="\_blank"}
- Dabbling in watercolors.
- Making this website marginally better.
