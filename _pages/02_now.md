What I'm doing right now:

- Going remote: [read the on-going documentation about the process]({{site.baseurl}}/going-remote-live-documentation/).
- Transitioning out of my fullstack gig at [Hosman](https://www.hosman.co){:target="\_blank"}.
- [Acquiring German]({{site.baseurl}}/scribbles/#2020-06-17) by reading Harry Potter und der Stein den Weisen (despite JFK's anti-trans stance ðŸ˜­).
- Reading a lot of feminism books.
- Making new friends and taking care of old ones.
