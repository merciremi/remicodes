What I'm doing right now:

- Making new friends and taking care of old ones.
- Staying the fuck home (again) thanks to Covid-19.
- [Building furnitures]({{site.baseurl}}/scribbles/#2020-07-18).
- Learning the ropes of fully remote working: [read the on-going documentation about the process]({{site.baseurl}}/going-remote-live-documentation/).
- Making book streaming better, one commit at a time, with a new team (more on that later this year).
