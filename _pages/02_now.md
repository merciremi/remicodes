What I'm doing right now:

- Taking a two-month sabbatical and discovering my new surroundings.
- Building furnitures.
- Going remote: [read the on-going documentation about the process]({{site.baseurl}}/going-remote-live-documentation/).
- [Acquiring German]({{site.baseurl}}/scribbles/#2020-06-17) by reading Harry Potter und der Stein den Weisen (despite JFK's anti-trans stance ðŸ˜­).
- Making new friends and taking care of old ones.
