What I'm doing right now:

- Untangling and consolidating codebases in needs.
- Looking for [a new team to join]({{site.baseurl}}/work/).
- Working my way through [Rebuilding Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/){:target="\_blank"} by Noah Gibbs.
- Learning the [fundamentals of Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html){:target="\_blank"}.
- Walking and climbing the local mountains, and taking pictures along the way.
- Watching our neighborhood shared garden grow wildly, thanks to the lucky mix of rain and sun we've had for months.
- Lobbying for better LGBTQIA+ policies in France.
