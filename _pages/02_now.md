What I'm doing right now:

- Walking and climbing the local mountains, and taking pictures along the way.
- Watching our shared garden grow wildly, thanks to the lucky mix of rain and sun we've had for months.
- Lobbying for better LGBTQIA+ policies in France.
- Untangling and consolidating codebases in needs.
