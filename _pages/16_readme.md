Hey there,

Welcome to my user manual! I've written it to help coworkers get to know how I work, and my quirks. This document is a work-in-progress (obviously).

_First version written on <time>2023/12/04</time>._

## My role at #{your_organisation}

My official titles usually are "back-end developer", "software engineer" or "fullstack developer".

I'm here to translate business needs into code. This follows two main paths:
  - Building new features.
  - Consolidating the codebase: building test coverage, refactoring, YAGNI-ing your codebase. I - sometimes - call myself "the Mrs Doubtfire of Code".

## What I value

  - **Calm environments**: Clear processes over chaos, product clarity over investor-pleasing roadmaps, deep focus over long hours, written documents over Slack conversations.
  - A focus on creating **useful features** for users.
  - Warm, kind, supportive colleagues in a **high-trust environment**.

## My style

  - **Playing the long-game**: I'll often advocate for that extra refactoring or for taking the time to find the appropriate abstraction over rushing a half-assed feature to the finish line.
  - **Reducing complexity**: This ties with the long-game. My goal, as a programmer, is to build applications that are robust, self-explanatory and with as little complexity as possible. Shameless-green code > cleverish-egotistical code.
  - **Explicit > Implicit**: Implicit breeds injustice (something I **strongly** dislike). I will always try to be as explicit as possible.
  - **Autonomy**: I favour autonomy and I like to create environments that empower people to be so: clear processes, clear channels of communications, etc.
  - **Laughing**: I laugh often and super loud, please adjust the output settings of your headset. 😅

## What I need to improve, work-wise

  - Keeping engaged with people as I turn into a human bear for the whole winter.
  - Don’t overengineer it: a common default in my line of work.

## Best way to communicate with me

I prefer asynchronous communication. Here's a breakdown:
  - For general communications: Slack messages.
  - For urgent communications: Slack or videocalls.
  - For technical communications (feature spec, postmortems): Notion/Linear/etc issues, Github pull requests.
  - For administrative communications: emails.

I check my emails once a week, so if you send me something urgent there, please ping me on Slack.

Please, never call/text me on my phone. The only exception being:
  - We're meeting up for a team retreat and we need to find each other in a crowdy place.

Most notifications are either **turned off or muted** on my machine. When I read your message, I'll mark it with a "memo" emoji (📝) so you know I'm not ghosting you. If you need more from me, I'll get back to you whenever I'm done with my current task. Focus is my main priority.

### Working hours

  - I'm a 9 to 5-ish person.
  - I don't work Wednesday mornings.

### How I give feedback

  - Explicitly.
  - Always striving to be fair and kind.
  - On your pull requests: I try to stick to [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/).

### How I like to receive feedback

  - Explicitly.
  - Always striving to be fair and kind.
  - On my pull requests: I'd strongly encourage you to stick to [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/). This will help with points #1 and #2.
  - I like getting 1:1 with my managers on a monthly basis.

Last, I know __radical honesty__ is a thing in tech. I think it's a fancy term coined by toxic men who don't want to be bothered learning empathy. Explict feedback, yes. Being a jerk, no.

### What I have zero patience for

- Toxic behaviors: misoginy, racism, contradictory demands, harassment, ghosting, etc.
- Micro-management.

### What people misunderstand about me

**I'm not a corporate person AT ALL**. I believe in a job well done, in being nice to other people, etc.

What I don't believe in are "grand mission" statements, motivational posters and the usual tech brouhaha.

**I have strong boundaries** around work. This will pass as being *Not Engaged Enough™* but let me assure you:

> Chi va piano, va sano e va lontano.

### Topics I’m always happy to talk about

You won't shut me up about hiking, climbing, cooking, raising kiddos, pour-over coffee nerdism.

I can also be quite a bore when it comes to art history - specifically stained-glass, medieval churches and Roman mosaics.

### Other things you might want to know:

- Fruit on pizza? How dare you? Of course, fruit on pizza! You snob!
- My coffee order: I start every day with a V60 pour-over filled with Ethiopian beans, lightly roasted. Gee, now I want a coffee, wait for me.
- I don't drink any alcohol. Kombucha I love, though.
- My favorite GIF:
