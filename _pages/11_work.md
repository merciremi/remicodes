ðŸ‘‹ Hey, future coworker! Thank you for checking in, and welcome to my corner of the internet. Your being here probably means youâ€™re interested in working with me. Let me tell you what to expect.

## Who am I?

I'm a Ruby on Rails programmer, a writer, and a former stained-glass master (yup).

I've been a professional developer for the past four and a half years, **mainly focusing on back-end programming**. Before being a software engineer, I held an awful lot of positions, both in tech and non-tech fields for almost 15 years. If you're interested, you can read the whole story of [how I switched careers]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/).

My go-to languages are [Ruby]({{site.baseurl}}/series/ruby/) and [Ruby on Rails]({{site.baseurl}}/series/rails/) (each with their respective toolbox). Mostly, I use *boring technologies* - Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq, vanilla Javascript, RSpec, Git etc. Boring, as in *I don't get hyped by every new fancy framework sent my way*.

I like majestic monoliths. I think they work very well for 99% of companies. But when needed, I've shipped micro-services in production as well (relying of Kafka).

Despite focusing on back-end programming, I also enjoy making shiny front-end code (as long as it's not my main occupation). I know my way around HTML and CSS. I've also dabbled in Javascript frameworks - Vue and React (even if I don't like using them).

As I've moved up the **Individual Contributor** path, my daily contributions now revolve around:
- designing and implementing features,
- writing specifications,
- code architecture,
- shipping APIs used by millions of users,
- [increasing code coverage]({{site.baseurl}}/series/rspec/),
- interacting with databases,
- [troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/series/debugging/),
- [mentoring junior developers]({{site.baseurl}}/series/carreer/),
- documenting practices and processes,
- and so much more.

I also run this website where I share what I learned while building software. It's my way of giving back to the dev community. My posts are often featured in Ruby Weekly, HN, etc... As of 2022, *more than 18,700 unique visitors visited this website*. Some articles even got me invited on [podcasts]({{site.baseurl}}/talks/).

My top 3 articles are:
- [Exploring dependency injection in Ruby]({{site.baseurl}}/dependency-injection-in-ruby/) (4.4k views)
- [Build a minimal feature flags manager in under an hour]({{site.baseurl}}/minimal-feature-flags-manager/) (3.7k views)
- [Introduction to Git Bisect: travel through time and bugs]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-use-git-bisect/) (2.9k views)

## Work history (as a software engineer)

Previously at [Youboox](https://nextory.com/fr/){:target="\_blank"} (acquired by Nextory), [Hosman](https://www.hosman.co/){:target="\_blank"}, and [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/fr){:target="\_blank"}. For more details, see my CV.

## What am I looking for?

In terms of technical challenges:
- Mid-level back-end challenges: features' architecture, specifications, improving performances, etc.
- Shaping features based on users' needs and companies' goals.
- Improve tooling and engineering standards.

In term of working environment:
- Calm companies: Clear processes over chaos, emails over meetings, product clarity over investor-pleasing roadmaps, deep focus over long hours.
- Warm, kind, supportive colleagues in an high-trust environment.
- Working within a diverse team with various backgrounds and expertises.
- Fully remote.
- 4-day work week.

## How do I like to interview companies?

- My favourite technical tests are remote live codings where we hash out a real-life challenge: Build a tested API or add a feature to an existing codebase with a preliminary refactoring.
- I like to talk to several people, both from my future team and other teams.
- I ask a lot of questions about your investors, your financial strength, how you resolved conflicts, etc...
- I usually back-channel my way into your employees' DMs to get a less "corporate-y" sense of your company.
- [A reject fast, reject early mentalilty](https://juanitofatas.com/reject-fast-reject-early){:target="\_blank"}.

Remember, I'm interviewing you as much as you're interviewing me.

I've realized, over the past 20 years, that the recruiting process is a good preview of what I can expect as an employee. It shows the quality (or lack thereof) of your processes, your priorities, how you handle requests, etc...

## FAQ

### Would you relocate to ______?

No, I wouldn't.

I've been working remotely for the past four years and **I intend to keep it that way for the foreseeable future**. And since you brooched the subject, why would you keep offices when you can attract talents from everywhere?

### Are you willing to come to the office from time to time?

For the past three years, **I've come once a year in the office**. And to be honest, I think it's more than enough. I've learned more about my colleague remotely than in person. This is where building a solid remote culture is key.

But, I'll be happy to come for a couple of days as much as **once a quarter**, as long as travel expenses are covered by the company.

### In-office of remotely?

Same answer as the previous question: fully remote positions only.

Remote working has proven a godsend for me. I'm not your typical 9-5 worker. You often won't find me in my chair at 11am because I'm outside. Why would I get outside in the middle of the morning? Well, many reasons really: getting a fresh perspective on a technical challenge (a.k.a. Get outside instead of smashing your head on your keyboard), taking the kiddos to the river because it's beautiful outside, run an errand because shops are closed outside of working hours in my small town.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I'm [a former stained-glass master turned developer]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/). I think this answers the question, right?

But, seriously? Right now, I'm happy moving up the IC track. (By the way, do you have an IC track at your company?)

### Tea or coffee?

Of late, I've fallen into the tech-bro coffee-nerd clichÃ©. So, I'd say a coffee lighlty roasted (for a V60) with notes of acidity and floral scents. In a thin brimed cup. But I won't say no to a cup of Genmaicha.
