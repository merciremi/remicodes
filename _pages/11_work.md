üëã Hey, future coworker! Thank you for checking in, and welcome to my corner of the internet. Your being here probably means you‚Äôre interested in working with me. Let me tell you what to expect.

## Who am I?

I'm a Ruby on Rails programmer, a writer, and a former stained-glass master (yup).

I've been a professional developer for the past four and a half years, **mainly focusing on back-end programming**. Before being a software engineer, I held an awful lot of positions, both in tech and non-tech fields for almost 15 years. If you're interested, you can read the whole story of [how I switched careers]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/).

My go-to languages are [Ruby]({{site.baseurl}}/series/ruby/) and [Ruby on Rails]({{site.baseurl}}/series/rails/) (each with their respective toolbox). Mostly, I use *boring technologies* - Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq, vanilla Javascript, RSpec, Git etc. Boring, as in *I don't get hyped by every new fancy framework sent my way*.

I like majestic monoliths. I think they work very well for 99% of companies. But when needed, I've shipped micro-services in production as well (relying of Kafka).

Despite focusing on back-end programming, I also enjoy making shiny front-end code (as long as it's not my main occupation). I know my way around HTML and CSS. I've also dabbled in Javascript frameworks - Vue and React (even if I don't like using them).

As I've moved up the **Individual Contributor** path, my daily contributions now revolve around:
- designing and implementing features,
- writing specifications,
- code architecture,
- shipping APIs used by millions of users,
- [increasing code coverage]({{site.baseurl}}/series/rspec/),
- interacting with databases,
- [troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/series/debugging/),
- [mentoring junior developers]({{site.baseurl}}/series/carreer/),
- documenting practices and processes,
- and so much more.

<!-- add some of the coolest things I've done -->

I also run this website where I share what I learned while building software. It's my way of giving back to the dev community. My posts are often featured in Ruby Weekly, HN, etc... As of 2022, *more than 18,700 unique visitors visited this website*. Some articles even got me invited on [podcasts]({{site.baseurl}}/talks/).

My top 3 articles are:
- [Exploring dependency injection in Ruby]({{site.baseurl}}/dependency-injection-in-ruby/) (4.4k views)
- [Build a minimal feature flags manager in under an hour]({{site.baseurl}}/minimal-feature-flags-manager/) (3.7k views)
- [Introduction to Git Bisect: travel through time and bugs]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-use-git-bisect/) (2.9k views)

## Work history (as a software engineer)

Previously at [Youboox](https://nextory.com/fr/){:target="\_blank"} (acquired by Nextory), [Hosman](https://www.hosman.co/){:target="\_blank"}, and [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/fr){:target="\_blank"}. For more details, see my CV.

## What am I looking for?

In terms of technical challenges:
- Mid-level back-end challenges: features' architecture, specifications, improving performances, etc.
- Shaping features based on users' needs and companies' goals.
- Improve tooling and engineering standards.

In terms of the working environment:
- Calm companies: Clear processes over chaos, emails over meetings, product clarity over investor-pleasing roadmaps, deep focus over long hours.
- Warm, kind, supportive colleagues in a high-trust environment.
- Working within a diverse team with various backgrounds and expertise.
- Fully remote.
- 4-day work week.

## How do I like to interview companies?

- My favorite technical tests are remote live codings where we hash out a real-life challenge: Build a tested API or add a feature to an existing codebase with preliminary refactoring.
- I like meeting with several people from my future team and other teams.
- I ask questions about your investors, your financial strength, or how you resolved conflicts.
- I usually back-channel my way into your employees‚Äô DMs to get a less ‚Äúcorporate-y‚Äù sense of your company.
- [A reject fast, reject early mentalilty](https://juanitofatas.com/reject-fast-reject-early){:target="\_blank"}.

Remember, I'm interviewing you as much as you're interviewing me.

I've realized, over the past 20 years, that the recruiting process is a good preview of what I can expect as an employee. It shows the quality (or lack thereof) of your processes, your priorities, how you handle requests, etc...

## FAQ

### Q: Would you relocate to ______?

No, I wouldn't.

I've been working remotely for the past four years and **I intend to keep it that way for the foreseeable future**.

### Q: Are you willing to come to the office from time to time?

For the past three years, **I've come to the office once a year**. And to be honest, I think it's more than enough. I've learned more about my colleague remotely than in person. This is where building a solid remote culture is key.

However, I'll be happy to come for a few days, as much as **once a quarter**, as long as travel expenses are covered by the company.

### Q: In-office of remotely?

Same answer as the previous question: I'll only consider full remote positions.

Remote working has been a godsend for me. You often won't find me in my chair at 11 am because I'm outside. Why would I get out in the middle of the morning? Well, there are plenty of reasons: to get a renewed perspective on a technical challenge, to take the kids to the doctor, or to run an errand.

### Q: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I'm [a former stained-glass master turned developer]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/). I think this answers the question, right?

But, seriously? Right now, I'm happy moving up the IC track. (By the way, do you have an IC track at your company?)

### Q: Tea or coffee?

Of late, I've fallen into the tech-bro coffee-nerd clich√©. So, I'd say a lightly roasted coffee with notes of acidity and floral scents. In a thin-brimmed cup, please. I won't say no to a cup of Genmaicha, though.
