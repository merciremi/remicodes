ðŸ‘‹ Hey, future coworker! Thank you for checking in, and welcome to my corner of the internet. Your being here probably means youâ€™re interested in working with me. Let me tell you what to expect.

## Who am I?

I'm a Ruby on Rails programmer, a writer, and a former stained-glass master (yup).

I've worked in tech for ten years, and **I've been a professional developer for the past five years**, mainly focusing on back-end programming. Before being a programmer, I worked in product and marketing for startups, and held a lot of positions, both in and outside of tech for 15 years. [It's quite the story!]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/)

My go-to languages are [Ruby]({{site.baseurl}}/series/ruby/) and [Ruby on Rails]({{site.baseurl}}/series/rails/) (each with their respective toolbox). Mostly, I use *boring technologies* - Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq, vanilla Javascript, RSpec, Git, etc.

I'm currently learning the fundamentals of Rust, and leveling up in SQL and Javascript.

I like majestic monoliths. I think they work very well for 99% of companies. But when needed, I've shipped micro-services in production as well.

Despite focusing on back-end programming, I also dabbled on some front-end (vanilla JS, Reactjs and Vuejs).

## My daily contributions as a mid-level software engineer

As I've moved up the **Individual Contributor** path, my daily contributions now revolve around:
- designing and implementing features,
- [writing specifications]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-write-better-specifications/),
- code architecture,
- codebase consolidation,
- shipping APIs used by millions of users,
- [increasing code coverage]({{site.baseurl}}/series/rspec/),
- interacting with databases,
- [troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/series/debugging/),
- [mentoring junior developers]({{site.baseurl}}/series/career/),
- documenting practices and processes,
- and so much more.

To give you a concrete idea of what I can do, here are a couple of projects I've worked on over the past few years.

#### Real-time Developer Notifications (RTDN)

I helped implementing the mechanism handling server-to-server notifications from Google Playstore for subscription renewals based on specifications written with a senior developer. This new mechanism eventually replaced a monthly manual verification of our Playstore subscriptions, which was prone to errors and missed revenue.

#### Data synchronization across micro-services

I designed, specified and implemented bookmarks synchronization between legacy JAVA applications and an upcoming new version using Kafka events. This project allowed (and still allows) the back-end team to focus on building their latest application while ensuring data integrity.

#### Minimal feature flag manager

I designed and implemented a feature flag manager to enhance release phase for large features. You can read about the process here: [Build a minimal feature flags manager in under an hour](https://remimercier.com/minimal-feature-flags-manager/).

## Work history

Currently working at [Evalmee](https://en.evalmee.com/), a SaaS helping schools set up and grade their examinations.

Previously at [Youboox](https://nextory.com/fr/){:target="\_blank"} (acquired by Nextory), [Hosman](https://www.hosman.co/){:target="\_blank"}, and [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/fr){:target="\_blank"}. Before that, I worked as a marketing manager for a tech startup for four years. For more details, see my [CV]({{site.baseurl}}/media/shared/about/remi-mercier-cv-2024.pdf).

## Writing about what I learn

I also run this website where I share what I learned while building software. It's my way of giving back to the dev community. My posts are often featured in Ruby Weekly, HN, etc... As of 2022, *more than 18,700 unique visitors visited this website*. Some articles even got me invited on [podcasts]({{site.baseurl}}/talks/).

My top 3 articles are:
- [Exploring dependency injection in Ruby]({{site.baseurl}}/dependency-injection-in-ruby/) (4.7k views)
- [Build a minimal feature flags manager in under an hour]({{site.baseurl}}/minimal-feature-flags-manager/) (3.7k views)
- [Introduction to Git Bisect: travel through time and bugs]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-use-git-bisect/) (2.9k views)

As of early 2024, the best ways to get my posts are through [RSS](https://remimercier.com/feed.xml) and my ([newsletter!]({{site.baseurl}}/newsletter/)).

## What am I looking for?

In terms of technical challenges:
- Mid-level back-end contributions: feature specifications, code architecture, implementing features across their lifecycle, improving performances and code coverage, etc.
- Shaping features based on the needs of users and the companie's goals.
- Mentoring junior developers and reviewing merge requests.
- Improving the tooling and the engineering standards.

In terms of working environment:
- A focus on creating value for both users and company.
- Warm, kind, supportive colleagues in a high-trust environment.
- Working within a diverse team with various backgrounds and expertise.
- **Fully remote**.
- **4,5-day work week**.

You can check my [user manual]({{site.baseurl}}/user-manual/).

## How do I like to interview companies?

- My [favorite technical tests]({{site.baseurl}}/technical-tests-in-2023/) are remote live codings where we hash out a real-life challenge.
- I like meeting with several people from my future team and other teams.
- [A reject fast, reject early mentality](https://juanitofatas.com/reject-fast-reject-early){:target="\_blank"}.

For me, interviews are a two-way street. You get to know me. I get to know you.

I've realized, over the past 20 years, that the recruiting process is a good preview of what I can expect as a collaborator. It shows the quality of your processes, your priorities, how you handle requests, etc...

## FAQ

### Q: In-office or remotely?

I've been working remotely for the past four years and **I intend to keep it that way for the foreseeable future**.

Remote working has allowed me to do my best work, focus on better communication, and create (much) more value.

### Q: Would you relocate to ______?

No, I love living near the mountains so very much. **I'll only consider fully remote positions.**

### Q: Are you willing to come to the office from time to time?

For the past three years, **I've come to the office once a year**. But I'm open to come as much as **a few days once a month**.

### Q: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Every time I tried to answer this question, I ended up somewhere unexpected. After all, I'm [a former stained-glass master turned developer]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/).

Right now, I enjoy broadening my technical expertise, and moving up the IC track.

### Q: Tea or coffee?

Coffee, please! I'd say a lightly roasted coffee with notes of acidity and floral scents. I usually purchase my coffee from [my local roastery](https://kaffa-roastery.com/){:target="\_blank"}, in Crest, France.
