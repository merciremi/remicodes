First, let's address the elephant in the room:

*"How are we supposed to pronouce your name, Rémi?"*

Fear not, I'm here to help.

So, my full name is <strong>Rémi Mercier</strong>. It's pronounced: `ray · me · mercy · 'ey `.

If you want to pronouce it like I do, you’ll have to roll those Rs.

Now that you're *baguette*-ready, let us dive in.

## Who am I?

I’m an (almost) forty-year old programmer, writer, and former stained-glass master (yep).

Mountainous *Drôme* has been my family's home for the past 3 years. I love living there: quieter pace, beautiful landscapes and *amazing* food.

## Main occupation: software engineer

**I've worked in tech for ten years**, and I've been a professional developer for the past four and a half years, mainly focusing on back-end programming. Before being a programmer, I worked in product and marketing for startups. Before that, I held an awful lot of positions, both in non-tech fields for almost 15 years.

I was a stained-glass maker for four years. Moved on to museums and art galleries. Switched to marketing for tech start-ups. Then ended-up doing programming. [It's quite the story!]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/)

## Writing

I run this website where I share what I learned while building software. It's my way of giving back to the dev community. My posts are often featured in Ruby Weekly, HN, etc... I don't have analytics on my website anymore, so I don't know how many people read my stuff nowadays. In 2022, *more than 18,700 unique visitors visited this website*. Some articles even got me invited on [podcasts]({{site.baseurl}}/talks/).

My top 3 articles are:
- [Exploring dependency injection in Ruby]({{site.baseurl}}/dependency-injection-in-ruby/) (4.4k views)
- [Build a minimal feature flags manager in under an hour]({{site.baseurl}}/minimal-feature-flags-manager/) (3.7k views)
- [Introduction to Git Bisect: travel through time and bugs]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-use-git-bisect/) (2.9k views)

I'm still tinkering on sharing more unedited content on this website (and I still haven't figure it out). But right now, I like to write [unedited notes (called "fragments")]({{site.baseurl}}/fragments/) and [short personal tweet-like things]({{site.baseurl}}/scribbles/).

First and foremost, I love to write stories. I usually latch out on a subject and write quirky things about it. This website is no exception.

## Newsletter

As of early 2023, my newsletter is just a good way to receive my new posts before anyone else.

Last December, we crossed **200 subscribers** from all over the world!

I'm still looking to make it a more creative space. This will probably evolve in 2024 as I explore new ways of supporting my writing work ([stay tuned!]({{site.baseurl}}/newsletter/)).

## Slow pace

We've talked a lot about "workish" things so far: coding, writing, etc. Let's dive deeper.

A lot of my decisions - professional and personal - stem from the pursuit of a slower life.

Ten years ago, I embraced the motto "moving fast and breaking things". After putting in long hours and working my health off for years, I realized the things that end up breaking are (mostly) people. Since then, I've decided to examine what I care about deeply. And life rushing past me while I'm stuck in a rat race is not one of them.

So, slow pace.

No long hours. No meetings during lunch. No "stay at work" fuckery.

I like to bear witness to my life. I like to look through the window. I like doing things with purpose, calm, and pleasure. I like to sip warm coffee while listening to some records after dropping the kiddos to school.

## Drawing, design and art stuff

Drawing has played a big part in my life.

When I was 14, a teacher suggested I study design and applied arts. He had spotted me drawing caricatures of my schoolmates instead of taking notes.

Design has taught me a few important lessons:

- How to formulate a problem so it's understandable.
- There are many ways to solve a problem.
- How to clearly articulate my thoughts.
- Better done than perfect.

A few arty things I like a lot: romanesque architecture, stained-glass (obviously!), generative art (Matt Deslauriers ❤️)...

I also enjoy building things with my hands: some low-key woodworking, anything that could come up in restoring a 18-th century house (and let me tell you, A LOT can come up!).
