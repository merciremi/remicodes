First, let's address the elephant in the room:

*"How are we supposed to pronouce your name, Rémi?"*

So, my full name is <strong>Rémi Mercier</strong>. It's pronounced: `ray · me · mercy · 'ey `.

If you want to pronouce it like I do, you’ll have to roll those Rs.

## Who am I?

I’m a programmer, a writer, and a former stained-glass maker (yep).

Mountainous *Drôme* has been my home for the past 3 years. I love living there: quieter pace, beautiful landscapes and *amazing* food.

## Main occupation: software engineer

**I've worked in tech for ten years**, and I've been a professional developer for the past five years, mainly focusing on back-end programming. Before being a programmer, I worked in product and marketing for startups. Before that, I held an awful lot of positions, both in non-tech fields for almost 15 years.

Interested in the professional side of things? Head over to [the dedicated page]({{site.baseurl}}/work/).

## Writing

I run this website where I share what I learned while building software. It's my way of giving back to the dev community.

I focus on making things as simple to understand as possible: real-life examples, step-by-step tutorials, expressive naming, etc. No `def foo @bar; end` shenanigans.

I don't have analytics on my website anymore, but in 2022, close to 20,000 unique readers spent time on my website. My posts are often featured in Ruby Weekly, HN, etc...

## Newsletter

As of early 2023, my newsletter is just a good way to receive my new posts before anyone else.

Last December, we crossed **200 subscribers** from all over the world!

I'm still looking to make it a more creative space. This will probably evolve in 2024 as I explore new ways of supporting my writing work ([stay tuned!]({{site.baseurl}}/newsletter/)).

## Drawing, design and art stuff

Drawing has played a big part in my life.

When I was 14, a teacher suggested I study design and applied arts. He had spotted me drawing caricatures of my schoolmates instead of taking notes.

Design has taught me a few important lessons:

- How to formulate a problem so it's understandable.
- There are many ways to solve a problem.
- How to clearly articulate my thoughts.
- Better done than perfect.

A few arty things I like a lot: romanesque architecture, stained-glass (obviously!), generative art (Matt Deslauriers ❤️)...

I also enjoy building things with my hands: some low-key woodworking, anything that could come up in restoring a 18-th century house (and let me tell you, A LOT can come up!).
