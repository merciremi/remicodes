After almost a year of leaving my website live its life, I've come back to it. I spent last week errands reading my past articles, my notes, my scribbles, etc. Everything.

And I enjoyed it! It was a surprised for me. I thought I'd be more _blas√©_ about my own production.

Turns out, I ended up being quite proud of what I wrote. I loved the words, the design, the articulation. I even learned a few things I had forgotten. _[Build a minimal feature flags manager in under an hour]({{site.baseurl}}/minimal-feature-flags-manager/)_ is one of my favorite posts from these past months.

So sometimes, just raise your nose from the keyboard, and enjoy the work you've put out there. It's rewarding.
