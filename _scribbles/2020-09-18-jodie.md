The best career advice I've ever heard, courtesy of Jodie Whittaker's parents:

> Whittaker says she never once suffer negativity from her family. "The only discouragement I got was from a career adviser when I was 15 who told me [acting] was a stupid idea. She said you need a back-up plan, and thank God, my mum and dad are completely adamant that that's the wrong way to go. They said 'You're only 15, you don't need a back-up plan. Get a back-up plan if it all goes pear-shaped at 30. Just go do it'. I went 'Yeah!'."
