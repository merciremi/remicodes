  - I like to help people who are new to the dev world level up.
  - my essays are regularly featured in Ruby Weekly and various tech bootcamps syllabus.

  <p>I'm a Ruby on Rails developer, a writer, and a former stained-glass master (yup).</p>

  <p>I've built this place <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">to document what I learn</a> while building software, to jot down <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/fragments">my unedited notes</a>, to scribble <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/scribbles">random thoughts</a>, and to share bits about <a href="{{ '/about' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">myself</a>.

  <p>I help companies build their product and make a dent in the universe. I'm currently making book streaming a lil' bit better, one commit at a time. My toolbox includes beautiful Ruby, magical Rails, and good ol' Javascript. You can also check <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/now">what I'm doing right now</a>.</p>

  <p>Also, there are neither tracking nor analytics on this website. So, enjoy this moment of privacy!</p>
