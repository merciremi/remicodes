Last week, I announced to my fellow developers at Hosman that I would be leaving Paris this summer.  I've expressed my wish to keep working with the team as a fully distributed member.

## A bit of context

This was a long time coming. Living in the capital has proved more difficult by the day: air pollution is getting worse than ever, the pecking order/rat race too. The fam and I will be moving to the mountains in early July. Hopefully, we'll be able to slow the fuck down and breathe healthier air.

## What to expect?

I want to keep a live and public documentation on the process of going full remote. Why?

Well, first, to keep track of things for myself: the tasks at hand, what's already been done, the surprises along the way, etc. Second, I realized that there's little coverage on the very process of going remote: this might help other folks. Third, remote work is still culturally challenging for most companies - even though many successful companies are now fully distributed -. So, I want to gather here what it's like on the company's level.

This documentation will include:
- personal journey: taking a leap of faith, leaving out and moving in, caring for our friends and making new ones, etc...
- professional journey: communicating with the team, becoming (or not) the first remote employee in an on-site company, the back-and-forths, the challenges and the solutions, the outcome, etc.

I'll probably take the opportunity to start a [theme-based personal garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden){:target="\_blank"} with this new chapter of my professional life. It'll be easier to connect the dots than though an antichronological timeline of essays. But that'll come later.

The list below will serve as a table of content with due dates when relevant:

1. before_action <time>Feb 29, 2020</time>
  - [x] Decide on going full remote.
  - [x] Where should we go?
  - [x] Talk to remote developers (like Nicolas) about the tricks of the trade.
  - [x] Gather documentation about remote working (Remote, Zapier's guide).
2. Going remote with an on-site based company.
  - [x] Talk to my lead developer. <time>Mar 1, 2020</time>
  - [x] Talk to my CTO/one-third owner of the company. <time>Mar 1, 2020</time>
  - [ ] Get an agreement in principle from the owners. <time>Mar 16, 2020</time>
  - [ ] Based on answer, discuss terms for the remote position/the severance package.
  - [ ] Discuss terms for the remote position <time>Mar 31, 2020</time>
  - [ ] Get a final (non-)agreement and move on to paperwork. <time>Apr 7, 2020</time>
  - [ ] Plan new processes.
  - [ ] Shop for necessary tools.
3. Leaving Paris. <time>Jul 7th, 2020</time>
  - [ ] Find a new place.
  - [ ] Admin stuff: close current providers contracts, etc.

The list will evolve all year since I plan on documenting the whole thing: before, during, and after. Whenever I want to dig into a specific topic, I'll link the relevant post on the list.

Are you a remote worker or currently in the process of going remote? Come and say ðŸ‘‹ on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mercier_remi){:target="\_blank"} or email me at `hello [at] remimercier.com`! I'd be happy to chat with you.

Noticed something? [Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/merciremi/remicodes/issues/new).

Cheers,
