It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single developer in possession of a good codebase must be in want of a bug-free application [^1].

Alas, debugging never ends. The more you learn, the more debugging becomes complex.

I think it is high time we dive deeper into `pry-byebug`. Are you new to `pry-byebug`? Go and check [the beginners introduction to debugging your code]({{site.baseurl}}/pry-byebug-tutorial/) first.

Here our _menu du jour_: moving in the stack frame, adding breakpoints on the fly, and some handy shortcuts (because who loves to write `continue` continually).

## Step into the stack frame: `step`

I discovered `step` only recently. One easy way to understand `step` is to explain it in contrast to `next`.

`next` executes the next line in your current context. `step` steps into the specific context - the **frame** - of the next line in your code.

The following example is a basic endpoint that allows me to get all available books and a `Book` model with a class method.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # app/controllers/books_controller.rb
  class BooksController < BaseController
    def index
      binding.pry

      available_books = Book.available

      render json: available_books
    end
  end

  # app/model/book.rb
  class Book < ApplicationRecord
    def self.available
      where(available: true)
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

The breakpoint will pause execution before `.available` and open a debugging console.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
 => 04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
    06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

When I type `next`, the result of `Book.available` is assigned to `available_books` and the execution stops before the next line.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
    04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
 => 06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

What happened in `Book.available`? I don't know. I only executed that line of code and stayed in my current frame - `BooksController`.

Let's re-run my code and use `step` instead.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
 => 04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
    06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

Typing `step` takes me from my `BooksController` to my `Book` model. I've changed frames. I'm now exploring the class method `Book.available`.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 2 Book.available:

    01:   def self.available
 => 02:     where(available: true)
    03:   end
{% endhighlight %}

I can now check whether my class method works as intended.

Disclaimer: `step` is a bit of a rabbit hole. It's a great way to explore how Rails works. For instance, if I type `step` before `where(available: true)`, my console returns:

{% highlight irb %}
  From: .rbenv/versions/2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/activerecord-6.0.3.4/lib/active_record/querying.rb:21 ActiveRecord::Querying#where:

 => 21: delegate(*QUERYING_METHODS, to: :all)`
{% endhighlight %}

Yep, I'm now checking out ActiveRecord's inner gut.

## Move up the stack frame: `up`

Remember when we dived into the frames? Well, how do I come back to my `BooksController`? With `up`, of course.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 2 Book.available:

    01:   def self.available
 => 02:     where(available: true)
    03:   end
{% endhighlight %}

If I type `up` in my console, I'll move up the frames towards my initial breakpoint.

What if I've moved down frames several times? I can either pass the number of frames I'd like to go up as an argument - `up(2)` - or type `up` several times.

## Add and remove breakpoints on the fly

### 1) Add a breakpoint from the console: `break`

If I realize, once I'm in my debugging console, that I would have needed another breakpoint, I can add it on the fly with `break line_number`.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
 => 04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
    06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end

  [1] pry(BooksController#index)> break 06

  Breakpoint 1: /path/controllers/books_controller.rb @ 06 (Enabled)

     01:   def index
     02:     binding.pry
     03:
     04:     available_books = Book.available
     05:
  => 06:     render json: available_books
     07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

I can type `break 06`, resume the execution, and have it paused before the `render json`.

A few things to consider:
- `Breakpoint 1: /path/controllers/books_controller.rb @ 06 (Enabled)` gives me my new breakpoint reference number: `1`. This will come handly later.
- What appears after `Breakpoint 1 ...` is part of my breakpoint's information. Not where my program is currently paused.

Adding breakpoint son the fly makes for a pretty seamless debugging experience. I used to exit the `pry` session, go back to my code, add a new breakpoint, then re-run execution. Let me tell you, `break 06` came as a relief!

### 2) Remove a breakpoint from the console: `break --delete breakpoint_number` or `break -D breakpoint_number`

So, now my program is paused before the line 04, and I know I added a second breakpoint on the line 06:

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
 => 04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
    06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

What if I want to remove this second breakpoint?

First, I want to find my breakpoint's reference by listing all breakpoints with `break`. Then, I can delete the breakpoint with `break --delete breakpoint_number`.

{% highlight irb %}
  [1] pry(BooksController#index)> break

  # Enabled At
  -------------

  1 Yes     /path/controllers/books_controller.rb @ 06


  [2] pry(BooksController#index)> break --delete 1

  # Enabled At
   -------------
{% endhighlight %}

`break` outputs the list of all the breakpoints added in the console.

`break --delete breakpoint_number` outputs the list of all remaining breakpoints.

### 3) Show breakpoints information: `break --show breakpoint_number`

{% highlight irb %}
  [1] pry(BooksController#index)> break --show 1

    Breakpoint 1: /path/controllers/books_controller.rb @ 06 (Enabled)

     01:   def index
     02:     binding.pry
     03:
     04:     available_books = Book.available
     05:
  => 06:     render json: available_books
     07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

This is the same output that the one I get after adding a breakpoint.

## Check your latest commands: `history`

`history` gives me a list of all past commands I ran during the current `pry` session.

## Commands and aliases

Finally, here's a handy table with some commands and their aliases.

| command          | alias      | expected behavior
| ---              | ---        | ---
| `wherami`        | `@`        | prints out your current context
| `continue`       | `c`        | continue program execution
| `next`           | `n`        | execute the next line in the current stack frame
| `step`           | `s`        | step execution into the next line
| `break --delete` | `break -D` | delete a breakpoint
| `break --show`   | `break -s` | show a breakpoints details and source


There's only one thing left to say: Happy debugging!
