It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single developer in possession of a good codebase must be in want of a bug-free application [^1].

Alas, debugging never ends. The more you learn, the more debugging becomes complex.

I think it is high time we dive deeper into `pry-byebug`. Are you new to `pry-byebug`? Go and check [the beginners introduction to debugging your code](({{site.baseurl}}/pry-byebug-tutorial/)) first.

Here our _menu du jour_: moving in the stack frame, adding breakpoints on the fly, and some handy shortcuts (because who loves to write `continue` continually).

## Step into the stack frame: `step`

I discovered `step` only recently. One easy way to understand `step` is to explain it in contrast to `next`.

`next` executes the next line in your current context. `step` steps into the specific context - the **frame** - of the next line in your code.

The following example is a basic endpoint that allows me to get all available books and a `Book` model with a class method.

{% highlight ruby %}
  # app/controllers/books_controller.rb
  class BooksController < BaseController
    def index
      binding.pry

      available_books = Book.available

      render json: available_books
    end
  end

  # app/model/book.rb
  class Book < ApplicationRecord
    def self.available
      where(available: true)
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

The breakpoint will pause execution before `.available` and open a debugging console.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
 => 04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
    06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

When I type `next`, the result of `Book.available` is assigned to `available_books` and the execution stops before the next line.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
    04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
 => 06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

What happened in `Book.available`? I don't know. I only executed that line of code and stayed in my current frame - `BooksController`.

Let's re-run my code and use `step` instead.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
 => 04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
    06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

Typing `step` takes me from my `BooksController` to my `Book` model. I've changed frames. I'm now exploring the class method `Book.available`.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 2 Book.available:

    01:   def self.available
 => 02:     where(available: true)
    03:   end
{% endhighlight %}

I can now check whether my class method worls as intended.

Disclaimer: `step` is a bit of a rabbit hole. It's a great way to explore how Rails works. For instance, if I type `step` before `where(available: true)`, my console returns:

{% highlight irb %}
  From: .rbenv/versions/2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/activerecord-6.0.3.4/lib/active_record/querying.rb:21 ActiveRecord::Querying#where:

 => 21: delegate(*QUERYING_METHODS, to: :all)`
{% endhighlight %}

Yep, I'm now checking out ActiveRecord's inner gut.

## Move up the stack frame: `up`

Remember when we dived into the frames? Well, how do I come back to my `BooksController`? With `up`, of course.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 2 Book.available:

    01:   def self.available
 => 02:     where(available: true)
    03:   end
{% endhighlight %}

If I type `up` in my console, I'll move up the frames towards my initial breakpoint.

What if I've moved down frames several times? I can either pass the number of frames I'd like to go up as an argument - `up(2)` - or type `up` several times.

## Add a breakpoint from the console: `break`

If I realize, once I'm in my debugging console, that I would have needed another breakpoint, I can add it on the fly with `break line_number`.

{% highlight irb %}
  From: (pry) @ line 4 BooksController#index:

    01:   def index
    02:     binding.pry
    03:
 => 04:     available_books = Book.available
    05:
    06:     render json: available_books
    07:   end
{% endhighlight %}

I can type `break 05`, resume the execution, and have it paused before the `render json`.

I used to exit the `pry` session, go back to my code, add a new breakpoint, then re-run execution. Let me tell you, `break 05` came as a relief!

## Check your latest commands: `history`

`history` gives me a list of all past commands I ran during the current `pry` session.

## Aliases

Finally, here's a handy table with some commands and their aliases.

| alias     | command    | expected behavior
| ---       | ---        | ---
| `@`       | `wherami`  | prints out your current context
| `c`       | `continue` | continue program execution
| `n`       | `next`     | execute the next line in the current stack frame
| `s`       | `step`     | step execution into the next line


There's only one thing left to say: Happy debugging!
