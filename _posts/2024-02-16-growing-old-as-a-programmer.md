I‚Äôll be turning 40 this year, and I‚Äôve started to wonder about my professional life in the next two decades. Not a lot of 60-year-old developers, hey?

[I started working some twenty years ago]({{site.baseurl}}/from-stained-glass-master-to-software-developer/), and I feel I need to plan - albeit very loosely - for the future. Building software is still very new to me. I want to keep working at it for some time. But I don‚Äôt know how to make this job grow with me.

Any > 40-year old developers out there that'd like to share their perspective? How did you grow (technically, managing, etc...)? Picked up fields over others (embeded systems over web app, for instance)?">
</figure>

I shared my angst with folks on Mastodon. Turns out, there is a handful (*\*cough\**) of older programmers. Many were kind enough to share their experience publicly.

This post is a collection of their replies, loosely sorted into broad categories. I'll add some thoughts or reactions along the way.

## Learn to learn

Learn to learn as always been a mantra for me. But as I grow older, I also realize I don't want to learn new things only to stay relevant. I need topics to be fun and interesting (I know, the audacity!).

This strategy / philosophy is probably the most represented in the replies.

  <p>I‚Äôm a hair away from 40 and often the oldest on a team, I swung into management early. Keep learning, keep learning keep learning. Write a lot. Communication skills become more important since people start giving you less of the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Older engineers I‚Äôve managed usually fill their niche and go home at 5. Sometimes that niche is keep their heads down and execute. Other times it owning our incident response practice or other hard things that take a lot of skill</p>

  <p>Short answer: you grow in the sense that whatever experience you‚Äôve acquired loses its value over time. Technical skills become obsolete. Human skills stay relevant but people, values and norms change so you have to relearn them too.</p>

  <p>The most valuable thing I've done is to learn how to learn new things.</p><p>The second most valuable is learning to work collaboratively as part of a team. We can't have expertise in everything we touch, which means we need teamwork and coordination.</p><p>Third, for me, is doing fairly deep dives into other fields that have some transferable overlap with the work we do - mathematics, linguistics, event management, and historical dance are some of the ones I've used a lot.</p>

  <p>48 year old less programming but still some, mostly now concerned with making environments for stable running of software ie more on DEVOPS side, never stopped learning, more and learn stuff that does not expire, like principles of development , networking , specific programming environments are just exchangable tools</p>

  <p>i got lucky and had independent study in pascal in high school in the early 90s which is the extent of my formal training. I started in front end and moved farther and farther back over time as I liked that work better. </p><p>Did time a LOT of small (&lt; 5 dev) start ups where you had to learn everything from system management, people management, be/fe, dbs, devops etc because no one else was going to do it.</p>

  <p>I did a bit of Fortran coding at uni (physics major, not CS), then upon graduation went to silicon valley at an electronics startup in QA dept and did some non-trivial coding in an early spreadsheet (least-squares curve fitting and X-bar/R-chart for production stats tracking).  After that, moved to Sacramento to work at a DoD missile contractor and wrote image processing code for an aerospace CT scanner (Fortran and C). Then wrote medical imaging software for an eye/retina imaging company (C/DOS). After that, C/Unix/SQL first at an ERP/MRP company followed by C/C++/Unix/Windows at two network management systems vendors.  Finally, I foolishly started a Java enterprise sw company, and after that, just boring jobs mostly in C#. Now, I write code for my own projects.  I didn't really learn much about CS until about 2005-2010 because it wasn't needed and I wasn't even aware of CS course topics like Algorithms:(  Now, I've self taught myself enough CS for the projects I'm currently working on.  Edit: about 8 years ago I took some MOOC ML courses and learned R, but this didn't lead to a job doing ML.  My website has some example coding side projects under the Tech Examples and ML Intro Project sub-pages which show that I've taught myself some CS:)</p>

  <p>I'm 58, and ended up as a software developer largely by accident and considerable investment of time in  trawling through tech books.  I didn't have a CS degree - something of which the industry appears to have grown increasingly disdainful.  I doubt that I'd have such an easy route into the profession now.  Currently between jobs, and finding that I'm having to work harder than ever in order to prove my worth.<br>I have tended to pursue jobs that seemed interesting over those that were well remunerated, and don't expect that I'll be able to retire. <br>I still try to absorb as much as I can from books and online tutorials, and the job still feels like running on quicksand.  Soft skills form a much more important component of my work than in my youth, but I'd be at a loss to say how I acquired them.  I hope I'm humbler and more humane in my interactions.<br>Given the benefit of hindsight, I'd definitely have done things differently. My current language of choice is Clojure, which offers the most fun I've had with a programming language since learning machine code back in the early 80s.<br>That was terribly long-winded.  Sorry about that!</p>

  <p>I've always been a technical person not management. Over time the technology we used changed. I had the option to stay where I was comfortable and maintain a legacy system or take on new things. I've always chosen the new things. Being willing to learn new things is a key skill.</p>

  <p>I'm now 51, started (non professional of course) programming at age of 12, and professionally at 23. I worked in various fields and adopted constant curiosity: learnt new languages (C and C++ in the 90s, Java then ruby, clojure and Scala, some php/js and finally go), paradigms (functional programming was eye opener), and skills (mentoring, documentation). Working on open source projects taught me a lot. I've been managing a team for a few years but I'm still learning!</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm right at the end of a career, still coding, but not in thick of things. Best growth is by curiosity and inculcating an interest in stuff sane people shy away from and tackling hard problems. Everyone claims to be logical and reasoning, but that isn‚Äôt 100% true. You learn new skills because you have little choice. I‚Äôve done ~50 languages and a dozen platforms. Keep an eye out for new stuff that isn‚Äôt ideologically driven / making massive promissory claims, all unproven. ‚Ä¶</p>

  <p>I guess I'm a little over 40 by now. I did what I suppose anyone who takes the work seriously would do, regardless of their age. I tried to pay attention to new developments and learn the ones that looked as if they would be useful. There was usually a way to get a contract in which I could apply some of my existing skills while learning some new ones. Today, with almost everything available online, it's surely easier to do that than in the early years of my career. Why wouldn't you?</p>

  <p>Just turned 40 and just starting to feel old. I keep learning new skills because they're required to solve the problems I have. But I work in very small teams, usually as the most senior person by far, so there aren't many others to lean on if I don't know something. And that forces me to learn it.</p><p>I say let the work guide you. If you aren't learning new skills at work, that usually means you aren't solving any new problems. Maybe because you're a small cog in a large machine, or because the work just isn't very innovative. If you can't find interesting problems at work, try looking for them outside of work.</p><p>Not saying work a second pseudo-job on top of the current one, more like, try to negotiate spending less than 100% of yourself at the current job, so you can spend a few percents of yourself on something that matters more to you, like more interesting problems.</p>

Ah yes. I could be one of these people who "get stuck in whatever mindset worked for them in their early career". The first 20 years of my professional life have been tough, so I'm happy to get a bit lazy.

  <p>As many have already said, one key to a long career is never stop learning. Any tech you use now will either fall out of use or evolve capabilities that alter the way you need to use it. Of course new things are continually coming along. Technical breadth matters as much as depth. Communication skills (listening, speaking, and writing) are essential. If you can‚Äôt understand others and/or they cannot understand you, your effectiveness and area of impact will be limited.</p>

  <p>I've remained curious. I play with technologies that catch my eye. (Crucially I don't play with everything as I don't have the time.) I enjoy what I do, and I do what I enjoy. I work hard on relationships, collaboration and communication. Having a blog turns out to be a way to create a long term memory that everyone can access. I try to notice talented people, help them where I can. I collaborate if there's an opportunity and learn from the experience</p>

The first mentor makes or breaks a career. It might sound a tad overdramatic, but having people truly interested in making you grow professionally (without being toxic about it) is a godsend.

I got lucky and met people who answered my insatiable questionning with generosity. And I learned a lot with them (Hi Thibault! Hi Jonathan! Hi Jeremy!)

## Too old

Aging in software is often conceived as dynamic, as in ‚ÄúIf I ever stop moving, I‚Äôll be left out.‚Äù And, some people seemed vindinctive with younger programmers rather than with a system built on cost reduction and ageism.

But this feeling sparks a (very) political question: What do you do when you‚Äôre not allowed to fit in anymore?

  <p>Big topic.</p><p>One aspect is the ever changing tech landscape and the energy and enthusiasm required to keep up.  Quite a few don't succeed, then if you do, you have to fight the resultant stereotypes and age discrimination.  I've felt age discrimination from late 30s onwards, ever increasing until I'm established and proven at a company.</p><p>It becomes increasingly tough for older SWEs who can't, or don't want to, shift into the completely different role of directing other people.  If you can find a good home, your experience can be put to good work and life is good.  A good older SWE can often be extremely productive, not least because they know how to make things simpler.  But perhaps the toughest thing is persuading people to hire you - in fact, probably the toughest thing is persuading them to interview you in the first place.</p><p>I've worked so often with many extremely prolific and energetic younger SWEs whose output is unnecessarily complex, obtuse, and intractable.  For me one of the most important parts of the job is spending time trying to work out how a solution can be simpler and clearer.  On the flipside I've also worked with older engineers who are stuck in the techniques and tools from 20+ years ago and seem unwilling to change.</p>

I've certainly proved at a few places I fit in great with younger coworkers.</p><p>I've tolerated lower salaries in exchange for interesting work, but that means I'm earning about what decent youngsters with 3 years experience are earning. People I mentor from nothing to semi-useful.  And even that doesn't make it easy for me to find work.</p><p>I have not pushed my children towards software, but when it's good, I really enjoy it.</p>

I never wanted to go into project management and haven‚Äôt done technical lead in a long time, mostly because I preferred working part time (60%) over rising in the ranks. Living and working in Switzerland ‚Äì that surely also makes a difference.</p>

I relate to the idea of always learning. I‚Äôve found it crucial for the past twenty years. Yet, I also relate to the dwindling of my curiosity tech-wise. Maybe it‚Äôs not so much about dwindling, but it‚Äôs less all-consuming, and more centered.

  <p>it has been a mix of interests and job opportunities - what I now do is, in a way, a reflex of my work history, but how I chose me jobs had much to do with my personal interests - and disinterests: for eg., I never had a job I couldn't do while being a GNU/Linux user - the fact that I've not been interested in positions where I'd need to be a Windows user in a way directed me towards some types of companies and work fields in detriment of others. The growth in terms of management was not a "carreer step" or something planned, it has been just a reflection of experience (not exactly age, but you need time to get experience, so...). It ends happening naturally: if you're working with people with less experience, you end up pointing paths out, warning about mistakes you are able to predict, etc.: it is normal that, having been there before, you have learned some lessons or from past mistakes... and being able to notice those things puts you naturally in a position of "guide" (call it "technical expert", "technical manager" or whatever else is the name for it in a certain company's structure). </p><p>I'm not quite sure what were you expecting for answers, so...

  <p>I had a huge panic around 40 that I would be too old to keep up and/or I would become bored. Turned out that being obsessed with making things work never gets old. I combined Product Management with coding for a more senior role + took more care of myself physically and mentally.</p>

  <p>48 year old here. Did not graduate college. Coding professionally for 25+ years. Fan of agile values and practices. In my 20s/30s I was big on continuously learning and adapting. In the last few years I've gotten pretty tired of jumping between technologies so much - there's always something new and "better". Pretty burned out at this point and currently on a self-imposed career break. It's possible my attitude is the problem. Or perhaps it's time for something different.</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm almost 50 and little has changed for me wrt the technical aspects of the work (I follow my passion to choose what I learn and the industry eventually catches-up in most cases).</p><p>What has changed a lot since 40 was learning about the importance of self-care, mental health and caring for others both at work and at home.  I learned a lot leading up to that point about the fallacy of meritocracy and the exploitative nature of capitalism.  I studied the labor movement and learned how we‚Äôve lost most of what they died for (in the U.S. at least) in the way we treat workers in the tech industry.</p><p>So the big difference between how I worked before and after 40 is that I don‚Äôt compete with my fellow workers, I help them however I can and I prioritize my actual family and  friends over my job.  These choices have had consequences and have limited my career in ways, but I‚Äôve still managed to make a living so far.</p><p>This, more than anything else has contributed more to my ability to keep learning continuously and exploring new ideas because without it I would have completely burned-out and left the field.</p>

I was steadfast in perl over python.  But I was ok with Bash scripting if the job fit it.</p><p>Later I learned php, some mysql, and a little python.  My bash scripting increased dramatically.

  <p>Mixture of being insanely curious about all sorts of things, and being in an environment (R&amp;D) where you can try new stuff.

  <p>Some other points of mine: teams FTW. People having a common mission working together is extremely fulfilling and joy. Doing anything "by the book" is stupid. Books give us all the ideas and patterns we need to know but we need to decide alone how and when to use them. Devs are not needed to program but to solve problems. We don't spend enough time to understand those problems and have hard times to think around the corner. We are responsible for what we build.</p>

  <p>The other key is learning how to work well with others, especially younger angrier folks, even if (a) you could do the job quicker than them and (b) they're irritating antisocial arrogant little shits.</p><p>You don't necessarily have to actively teach them, but you can "lead" by example and be a smooth operator, not a sharp annoyance. Some people (and technical issues) are not your problem to solve. Learn to be OK with that.</p>

  <p>I am in a long- running software study group. We  met three times a month, voting on a book to cover one or two chapters a week. There were a lot of books about Java. I continued to attend, even though I never used Java at work, although I did get into Apache ant for a while. A couple of years ago, we switched from Books to videos. We choose our topics by vote from the Thoughtworks radars, published quarterly. BTW,1  new skill per quarter is not too bad a goal shoot for.üç∏üêà</p>

  <p><br>‚Ä¶I never wanted to manage as I know I‚Äôm bad at it and it is hard to do well. Thus consulting is a great gig if you are not climbing. But you need to develop good relationships with peers and CEO types and do loss leading work sometimes. Hardest thing? Peers will age out so no referrals and you have to cold call the young. Some folks fear gray hair and don‚Äôt want your body around, some think you‚Äôre feeble because you try to NOT write code, or only write after solving problems in your mind.</p>

  <p>just turned 43. My career was a pretty linear path from junior dev to principal engineer over 25 years.  The largest jumps in my learning came from switching companies and being given completely new domain challenges, or new bits of stack that made me rethink the patterns I was used to (like switching databases, or cloud providers).</p><p>The thing that probably makes me a bit of an odd duck, to some, is that my entire career has been in JavaScript, and theres no sign of that changing.</p>

  <p>Hi Remi. I stayed on a technical track for my entire career (35+ years), moving through roles team lead, etc, to various sr dev / architectural roles.<br> <br>Some things I think I was good at: picking up new areas quickly, and being able to ask relevant questions without having all the details yet; give clear non-technobabble explanations of a complex situation; re-evaluate my "gut reactions" when challenged; help others break down a problem into clear pieces.</p><p>Happy to chat more.</p>

  <p>I've found that I don't have "a" resume anymore. I constantly repackage my work history for my potential freelance clients.

I do a fair bit of research on clients and their teams to decide how to present myself. Like many older devs, I've got a deep and varied enough history to make that worthwhile.</p>

  <p>53, programming since 27. My biggest growth came when I realized that my job shouldn't be to write code, but to help other people.

I didn't know what to expect, but many replies already struck a chord. I know I'll get back to the list, and I'm sure I'll be able to identify some strategies/ideas that'll work for me.
