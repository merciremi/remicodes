For years, I've worked without thinking much about feature specification. Many teams are reluctant to embrace opinionated methodologies, because these methodologies are usually tied to specific tools.

So, these teams stay in this limbo of empty Trello cards, neglected Jira tickets, and misaligned communication:

Today, **I want to share how to write better specifications for your features**.

This template was born out of several pain points:
- missing context around features,
- poor communication between teams,
- the resulting inertia preventing teams from kick-starting development,
- the need to fight scope creep.

And on a personal level:
- the necessity to channel my workflow,
- to stop delaying coding because of some perceived - often imaginary - technical difficulty.

I won't discuss the different methodologies (Agile, Shape Up, etc). This post is more granular:

{:.callout}
What happens when you - as a programmer - receive a feature assignment?

This template helped me significantly level up with handling more complex tasks. Here's a breakdown of its different chapters:
- summary
- context
- input
- output and testing scenarios
- possible implementations
- current challenges

## Summary

I always start my specification with a TLDR summary for the feature.

> The latest version of our API will handle the synchronization of books' data between legacy applications and the newest versions.

I like to keep my summary short and to the point. It helps me, when parsing the document, get the context of the feature, the problem I'm trying to solve, and the value I'm creating.

This summary could be a user story too. Whatever works for you, two-sentence style.

## Context

Context is where I gather as much information as possible about the problem I need to solve.

It may seem a tad overkill to many people, but I've realized - over the years - that I need the whole picture to streamline development. And so do many people.

I like this part to answer the following question:

{:.callout}
Which *part of my system* wants to *do what* to which *other parts of my system*?

This bit is generic on purpose - like a user story template. However, the context can get much more complex based on your needs.

I usually add graphs as well. I map out the different parts and how they relate to each other.

I don't necessarily follow UML notation and convention. As long as these graphs make sense to me and the team, it's fine.

</figure>

Graphs convey the complexity of the whole system. It's not just an input that's transformed and then output. Graphs allow people to grasp the successive steps of a feature. How the part fit in the whole.

A side note of flowcharts: I started using Mermaid.js last year. It's a bit of a learning curve, but I like how many development tools support it (Github, Gitlab, VSCode, etc).

## Input

You would not believe how many specifications lack the most basic information. Input is often assumed and almost always wrong.

In most companies, documentation is either non-existent or not updated. So, there's a big chance I won't be able to get accurate information from there. <strong>This is where opening lines of communication with other teams is crucial.</strong>

I know, from my graphs, that team A sends me the initial data in a JSON format. In this case, the keys of my JSON don't match my database attributes. So, I know I need to document the correspondence between names, types, etc.

The main idea is:

{:.callout}
Never assume. Always make sure.

Don't assume the data you receive is packaged in a nicely formatted JSON. Or that this JSON's structure is immutable. Once, I had a key that would either be present if the data was present, present with a `nil` value, or removed if the data was `nil` but from a different origin. Not cool.

Now is a good time to check your own data, as well. Never presume your database integrity. [You might have some surprises hidden in your oldest data]({{site.baseurl}}/pry-byebug-tutorial/).

## Output and testing schenarios

I know, from the flowcharts, that I need to output something. Whether it's a Kafka event or an HTTP response, I have to specify this *expected output*.

At this step, I usually start drafting my testing scenarios. I like mine in plain English. And I always start my list of scenarios with the happy path (i.e. when everything is going well).

<blockquote>
  A `Kafka event` is sent every time the `User` account has been charged for a new period. The event handler should produce a payload with the renewal information packaged as a JSON.
</blockquote>

Then, I like to get the various paths of divergence.

<blockquote>
  A retry mechanism should be triggerd every time the charging of the `User` account has failed for a new period. The event handler should not produce anything.
</blockquote>

With this type of scenario, I can TDD my feature with ease.

A note: I believe that one of the reasons most programmers don't test is because they lack testing scenarios. When you know how your application should behave, it's easier to cover your bases with some testing suite.

## Possible implementation

I don't always fill this part of the template. I'll explore possible implementations if the task is complex or the programmer needs guidance.

Thinking about implementation allows for preliminary conversations with coworkers. It's an easy way to catch misdirected efforts.

Also, you can move the testing scenarios from the `output` section to this part.

## Current challenges

It's hard to foresee possible roadblocks. But when our knowledge - or collective knowledge - of the codebase increases, I like to keep a list of potential problems.

## Conclusion

To conclude, I'd like to point out what this template is not:
  - an over-engineered waterfall-style document planning out all your application's features until the end of time,
  - a procrastination tool,
  - a document reserved for junior developers.

But, this document will help you:
  - have all the necessary information,
  - plan out your app behaviors and your testing scenarios,
  - have meaningful conversations with your teammates,
  - get documentation that can be linked to pull requests or issues.

Hope this template will be helpful to you as it is to me.

I'll catch you on the next one.
