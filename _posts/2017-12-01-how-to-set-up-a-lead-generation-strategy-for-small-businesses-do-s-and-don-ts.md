You‚Äôre building a product that can be used on the Internet? Good for you! But then, the thought of finding customers start to creep in. Should you talk about it now? Later? Should build a marketing war machine? Should you play it safe? After a few years of generating demand for companies, here is the gist of what I believe to be the best bet.

## 1. Keep it simple: kill the marketing war machine

When you want to build demand for your product, and someone says ‚Äúlet‚Äôs build a marketing war machine‚Äù (or whatever machinery analogy), walk out of the room. Physical machines are complex systems that are prone to bug and break. Marketing war machines are exactly the same. The more complex they get, the more prone to break at the slightest touch they are. Or to put it more plainly, I‚Äôd rather go with an old Defender than a brand new full-technology-loaded BMW. Let me show you the beauty of simplicity over bloated-unmanageable-complex systems.

First of all, when you‚Äôre a small business, you don‚Äôt have the time to do everything. A lot of solo founders run every aspect of their business alone. They code, design, tweet, support. Building a complex demand generation system takes time. A lot of time! But hey, let‚Äôs say you take the time and you build you awesome marketing war machine. You‚Äôve put in the time, you‚Äôve built the system, you know how it works, end of the story. The only thing is that you‚Äôre the only master here. So unpredictable mistakes are less likely to happen. But when your company‚Äôs growing, new people come in. And some of these people will use your marketing machine in ways you wouldn‚Äôt imagine (that‚Äôs the beauty and the curse of it). What was working smoothly with one (or two people) can become a big pile of üí© in a matter of weeks.

<span class="highlight">The more complex a system is, the more asymmetrical the ratio benefits/costs are. Sophisticated systems can be torn down by the smallest error.</span> If you have complex integrations between your marketing tools and your CRM, someone who doesn‚Äôt know the ins and outs of your system might make a honest mistake and synchronize thousands of unqualified contacts. Your API calls quota explodes, and your system is gripped until the next day. Sounds dreamy right?

When you build a complex demand gen system, you need to document it. It‚Äôs useful but it takes time. Now, let‚Äôs face the hard truth, nobody ever reads the documentation. Why? Because marketing tools are so easy to use! It feels like I know what I‚Äôm doing. Until it‚Äôs too late and I fucked something up. So while I end up reading the documentation, someone else in the team is left to clean the mess.

Time of maintenance grows exponentially with every layer of complexity. When you have complex integrations going back and forth between several tools, it‚Äôs easy to loose count of all loose ends. The time you waste in maintenance could be invested in creating more content, in shipping your next update or growing your website‚Äôs traffic.

## 2. Keep it simple redux: start by focusing on two points of entries

This is the number one practical advice I give every small business owner I talk with: focus on two points of entries depending on the buying intention. Just these two. And make these great!

The first people you should focus on are those who desperately want to give you money. They think your product is awesome and they want to try it. Why not taking their money?

You sell courses? Show me the table of content, some nudgets, etc. [Paul Jarvis](https://twitter.com/pjrvs) does this superbly. You sell a software? Let me see it and try it. You‚Äôre ashamed of showing your product on your website?  Now might be a good time to work on that redesign you‚Äôve been avoiding for so long.  One way or another, I need to try it! I need that first date to see if your product and I have anything in common.

[Ghost.org](https://ghost.org/features/) does a superb job showing off its awesome product (yep, I moved from WP to Ghost a few weeks ago). Another product that is doing this perfectly is [Livestorm](https://livestorm.co/). [Gilles](https://twitter.com/gillesbertaux) and his team went to great lenghts to show us what the product looks like.

Once you covered these prospects, focus on those who won‚Äôt buy just yet. I browse your website, read loads of articles and follow you on Twitter? Cool! I‚Äôm window-shopping. I have no intention of buying right now but I have a clear interest in your product. This is what newsletters are for. They keep me informed. They help your company grow your contact base until those who were not ready to buy become ready.

I have this theory (completely unverified, so feel free to prove me wrong üòÅ) that people know in a split second if they want to buy your product. The hardest part is to help them find the opportunity to do so.

One last thing: stop locking every damn piece of content behind closed doors. No matter how well designed your form is, I won‚Äôt give you my email to look at some videos. No, I won‚Äôt fill out a 20-field form to download your whitepaper. Make this content freely available. A 80-page whitepaper can be turned into ~30 articles. More words to share with everyone. More useful information that could rank and drive your traffic upward. Open things up!

## 3. Ruffling some feathers is good for ya

Companies that pledge to play it safe until they have an audience are aplenty. Companies that used this strategy and managed to get a massive following are almost non-existent.

<blockquote>Fear is always a shitty advisor.</blockquote>

When you‚Äôre the underdog, you don‚Äôt build an audience by being bland and boring. The euphemism ‚Äúcorporate communication‚Äù is usually a poor decision motivated by the fear of not pleasing everyone. And let‚Äôs be clear, whether you build a product for people or for companies doesn‚Äôt matter. Even people working for governmental agencies love to loosen up every now and then. There‚Äôs really no need to be so serious all the time.

Leaving a burning trail of good-humoured impertinence is often the best way to stick in your future customers‚Äô mind. Write about your beliefs, set the tone and get shit done. Before being acquired by [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/), French competitor Captain Train was rocking it. They never shied away from throwing a punch at their competitors‚Äô shitty endeavours.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúYou will never reach your destination if you stop and throw stones at every dog that barks‚Äù ‚Äì Churchill<br><br>Let them bark. you got work to do.</p>&mdash; Andreas Klinger ‚úåÔ∏è (@andreasklinger) <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasklinger/status/915289512850350080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

People tell you that your marketing is funny and you‚Äôre afraid they won‚Äôt take you seriously? Don‚Äôt run and hide behind the corporate bullshit. It‚Äôs probably the tree hiding the forest anyway. They already know they won‚Äôt buy from you. Maybe they already spent millions on a competitor or, may be they got used to that other crappy tool and they don‚Äôt want to change now. They‚Äôd rather give you fake reasons (e.g. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for your product to be more mature‚Äù) than real ones (sunk cost fallacy, resistance to change, etc).

Obviously, if you‚Äôre Deloitte, well, people expect you to be boring. [But even lawyers make cool shit nowadays (in French)](http://www.jurismatic.com/).  So get a spine and get your voice out there.

## 4. Don‚Äôt farm out content

First, don‚Äôt do ‚Äúcontent‚Äù. It‚Äôs usually a bad idea to treat words, voices and creativity as a commodity.

Finally, never, ever hire content agencies to write for you. They almost never take the time to get intimate with your business. You always need to spend countless hours correcting their crappy copy. Also, they write soulless boring stuff that will make everyone cringe and flee.

Farming out content usually ends up like this:

## 5. Be patient and keep shipping day in day out

Building demand takes a lot of time. Get used to the idea.

Looking for shortcuts won‚Äôt get you anywhere. Yes, I‚Äôm looking at you people spamming people from a list you bought (and killing off your deliverability score in the process üò§ ).

Focus on building a great product, writing cool articles, talking like a human being on Twitter‚Ä¶ every single day. These efforts will compound and make the most lasting effect on your sales. And this takes time.

Sure, from time to time, you can look for a *bon coup* (something that works really really well even though you're not absolutely sure why). But these one-off projects should be damn cool and useful to the people whose needs you‚Äôre looking to address. Otherwise, it‚Äôll just be a flash in the pan.

This part doesn‚Äôt sound like advice to you? Well, you‚Äôre either doing it naturally and don‚Äôt see how people can do it otherwise or you‚Äôre in for a very boring demand gen report at year end.

## 6. Meaning, Strategy, Means

Let‚Äôs remind us the three pilars of a job well done:

- the meaning: ‚ÄúWhy am I doing this?‚Äù ü§î
- the strategy: ‚ÄúShould we build a marketing war machine?‚Äù üôà (See above for the answer to that question)
- the means: ‚ÄúAm I being given all the information and authority to build something that delivers on its promises?‚Äù ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

If your team can‚Äôt answer these three questions, your demand gen strategy will fail.

Two mistakes I see [again and again and again](https://youtu.be/9VDvgL58h_Y?t=4m17s):

- people in charge of the demand gen project are not given the means of doing their job properly (e.g. they can‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù to a shitty idea coming from higher up).
- team members interacting with the demand gen tools lack proper training (or they don't give a damn about using it properly).

For a demand gen strategy to work (also applies to a lot of other topics), you need to trust someone with the project and give her/him the authority to do so. The owner of the project should have the power to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù to ideas coming in regardless of the hierarchical position they were emitted from. The owner should have the authority to filter out shitty ideas. There‚Äôs no blame to lay on people suggesting shitty ideas. I suggest shitty ideas all the time. But letting shitty ideas move on to production because the owner of the project doesn‚Äôt have the company‚Äôs full support to say ‚Äúno‚Äù, is the best way to kill your demand gen strategy in the egg.

## 7. Red tape the tools, not the mind

When I was a stained glass maker (that‚Äôll make for another story), there was this saying:

<blockquote>You recognize the craftsman by its tools.</blockquote>

I had to keep my tools in perfect condition and my workbench clean because a single nail could break a piece of painted glass I‚Äôd then have to redo.

When it comes to marketing tools and CRM, your tools should be squeaky clean. I mean Bree van de Kamp clean. For example: define a naming taxonomy for your contact lists, create dos and don‚Äôts in your Trello boards‚Ä¶ Give everyone the ability to know what they can do and what they shouldn‚Äôt do. Be ruthless when enforcing these rules otherwise it‚Äôll become a huge mess in no time. And believe me, spending a month cleaning everyone‚Äôs mess is not something you‚Äôll enjoy.

But let creativity run wild! I see a lot of time invested in ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù strategies. Honestly, fuck these. Just play around, ship good enough projects to see what stick and what doesn‚Äôt. Never stop having fun! This, my friends, is the best advice you can get.
