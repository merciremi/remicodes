ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm RÃ©mi.

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer, a writer, and a former stained-glass master (yup).

I've built [remimercier.com](https://remimercier.com/) to share what I learn while building software.

Go and check my writing about: 
- [Ruby on Rails tutorials](https://remimercier.com/series/rails)
- [Ruby internals](https://remimercier.com/series/ruby)
- [RSpec fundamentals](https://remimercier.com/series/rspec)
- [Career growth](https://remimercier.com/series/career)
